  <title>Hilly Pilly &amp; the Little White Lie - Wayne Lobdell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Illustrations by Phyllis Pollema-Cahill. Hilly Pilly and The Little White Lie is based on the real life story of Wayne Lobdell&#39;s creation of a silly character that he portrayed for the entrainment of his four young children. The character, Hilly Pilly, a very forgetful and funny guy, could never seem to match his clothing properly and frequently came to visit in one of the children&#39;s rooms at bedtime. His antics and jokes brought joy and laughter to the Lobdell children and their cousins. Now at the request of his daughter and three sons, Wayne has re-created the same story about the Dell family for the entertainment of the eleven Lobdell grandchildren.   An inspiring abbreviated memoir of Wayne, including his wife, Terry, of 55 years, is also included. Wayne, as set forth in his first book, a memoir,Climb From The Cellar, was born in a basement apartment and survived a challenged teen life before meeting Terry when she was 14 and he 15." />

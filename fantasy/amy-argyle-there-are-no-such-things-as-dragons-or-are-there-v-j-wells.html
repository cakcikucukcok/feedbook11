Being a single father, Amy&#39;s dad worries about her. He feels she is lonely and has trouble making friends, particularly because she spends the summers with him, away from any friends she has made at school. He hopes their trip to Scotland will be an adventure for his strong little girl, but was Uncle Angus trying to make her believe that dragons are real?. Enjoy this story now and don&#39;t wait any longer to find out if dragons are real!" />

  <title>Tacit Agreements - Timothy M. Zuverink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Glenn Ruisdael, life isnt turning out quite the way he expected. At thirty-three, hes alone once more, living in the small town in Michigan where he was raised, chronically depressed and working a job thats below his abilities. He spends his days merely drifting along, drinking too much, and feeling like a failurebut things are about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
His grandmother, Sandra, has died, leaving him and his estranged brother, Martin, very wealthy. He has also inherited keys to two private rooms at the family mansionone, the sole domain of his grandfather, and the other, that of his grandmother. As he explores these rooms and discovers the truth, he is forced to admit that idols all have their feet of clay. But he also comes to realize that saints can be found in the most unlikely of places.&lt;/p&gt;
Checkered as his own past is, Glenn knows that the time has come to deal with his personal demons. He misses Gideon, his ex-lover in Minneapolis, an unconventionally spiritual man who challenged the core values by which hed been living. Glenn also realizes the time has come to try to reconnect with his
brother. Martin, after all, is the only family he has left.&lt;/p&gt;
Glenn knows he is at an important crossroads in life, and the path he chooses now will have repercussions reaching far into his future." />

  <title>Izz of Zia - Tom Icon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine a book that has you sitting at the edge of your seat, turning each page, from cover to cover with breathless anticipation. Your heart pounds, your hands sweat, your mind wanting to know what happens next. Have you ever read a book that has you mused one moment to the next, and then breaks your heart and leaves you with tears streaming down your cheeks. Are you ready for a read so thought provoking that after reading it you are left changed forever. This is that book.
 Izz of Zia is the first novel of a three part trilogy that can be interpreted on two separate horizontal stratums: as an exciting, fantasy, action, adventure, or as a deeply spiritual saga. Izz of Zia is set in the First Age of the Noble Kings, in the Middle Era of the First Millennia, in the year one hundred and eleven, in the days of King Ozzdon, in the Empire of Xylenia, on the planet Zia. Betrayal from within threatens to tear a world that has lived in peace for thousands of years apart forever.
 This work is a multi-faceted writing that intertwines heartbreak with adoration, deceit with truth, betrayal with loyalty, creating a web in which two young heartthrobs that are as different as the east is far from the west learn the fathomless meaning of passion, devotion and true love. This is a book about a faith filled heart that wills to keep going no matter how many time it breaks, no matter how low life beats it down, no matter how close death comes to sweeping it under, hope rises from within. Prepare to be inspired by a love whose story begs to be told, and refuses to be denied no matter how painful, tragic, or tear-jerking." />

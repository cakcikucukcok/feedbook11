  <title>Shaping a City - Mack Travis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Picture your downtown vacant, boarded up, while the malls surrounding your city are thriving. What would you do?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 1974 the politicians, merchants, community leaders, and business and property owners, of Ithaca, New York, joined together to transform main street into a pedestrian mall. Cornell University began an Industrial Research Park to keep and attract jobs. Developers began renovating run-down housing. City Planners crafted a long-range plan utilizing State legislation permitting a Business Improvement District (BID), with taxing authority to raise up to 20 percent of the City tax rate focused on downtown redevelopment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Shaping a City&lt;/I&gt; is the behind-the-scenes story of one developer’s involvement, from first buying and renovating small houses, gradually expanding his thinking and projects to include a recognition of the interdependence of the entire city—jobs, infrastructure, retail, housing, industry, taxation, banking and City Planning. It is the story of how he, along with other local developers transformed a quiet, economically challenged upstate New York town into one that is recognized nationally as among the best small cities in the country.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The lessons and principles of personal relationships, cooperation and collaboration, the importance of density, and the power of a Business Improvement District to catalyze change, are ones you can take home for the development and revitalization of your city.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>Homosexuality – Man Vs God - Amos Sibanda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are many things in this world that people do, whether harmless or harmful. The habits that are not good in life are very appealing and good ones less appealing. Common examples of bad habits are in eating, drinking, smoking, sex, and use of drugs. Trying to give advice on the bad habits is interfering with the entertainment of the people concerned.
For example in eating, there are many people who prefer junk food to good, healthy, and natural food. It takes the entirety of the whole universe to make them realize and concede that the practice is not good.
Some practices or actions that are sin to God, no matter how we view them, are so exciting and appealing that the people concerned strongly feel delighted to commit them. So this book is about these practices, actions, and their solutions. It reveals that there is no sinful action less or greater than the other. All sins are the same before God and are self-entertainment. When the law of God is transgressed it becomes sin.
Of course all of us have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Gods grace justifies us freely through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. No one is guiltless. How can a perpetual thief cast a stone at a homosexual? How can a murderer, with hands full of innocent blood, cast a stone at the homosexual? How can a coveter cast a stone at the homosexual? How can the fraudulent cast a stone at the homosexual? How can a homosexual cast a stone at these above? The list of those with planks in their eyes who see specks in other peoples eyes is long.
The solution to this sad state of affairs is to be unbiased; to be willing to know God, that He is real; and to be willing to explore the other side of the cointhat is to regret to be conscience stricken about a past action or attitude.
This change is only possible through Christ. It took God, the creator of the heavens, the earth, and the sea and everything in them to become flesh (named Jesus) for us to realize and concede that some of our practices or actions are not good before Him.
This is about Salvation. Ultimately, it is about freedom from sin in this world and the world to come which will be inherited by those who are willing to hear what the Holy Spirit says. The meek shall inherit the earth (Matthew 5:5)." />

  <title>His Brother&#39;s Gift (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Mary J. Forbes</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;From donor…to dad!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was a call that changed Will Rubens’s life. The rugged Alaskan bush pilot had just learned he was his orphaned nephew’s biological father. And the bearer of this shocking piece of news was a remarkable, irresistibly attractive woman named Savanna Stowe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Savanna had come to Starlight to bring father and orphaned son together. But did the sexy loner have what it took to raise a uniquely gifted child? The longer she spent with him, the more Savanna realised that Will had special gifts of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now the compassionate social worker had a secret wish: for the three of them to become a real family together.&lt;/p&gt;

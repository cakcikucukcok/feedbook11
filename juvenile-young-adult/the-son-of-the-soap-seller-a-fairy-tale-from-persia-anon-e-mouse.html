  <title>THE SON OF THE SOAP SELLER - A Fairy Tale from Persia - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 325&lt;br /&gt;
In this 325th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Persian Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE SON OF THE SOAP SELLER&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THERE once dwelt a poor but worthy man named Abdullah in Meshed, the Holy City, the place of pilgrimage, whose beautiful mosque with the golden dome is the glory of the kingdom of Persia. He barely managed to get a living by the sale of soap.&lt;br /&gt;
All day long, from sunrise to sunset, he tramped the city, crying out: &amp;quot;O brothers, buy my pure soap. There is none better in the city, as everyone knows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it was that there were many days when poor Abdullah did not sell enough to buy sufficient bread for himself and his little boy Ahmed.&lt;br /&gt;
But the days went on and things became blacker and blacker, when one day an adventure befell little Ahmed. On his way to school a dervish, leading a fine lion by a chain, stopped opposite him. Then there came a palanquin borne on the backs of four mules.&lt;br /&gt;
The party stopped just opposite to Ahmed, and from the palanquin there alighted a lady closely veiled with the dervish and lion at attention close by.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For some reason the lion suddenly broke loose, causing mayhem. Then with a roar the lion sprang upon the princess, and bore her to the ground; but ere he could tear her to pieces, Ahmed had sprang forward, seized a piece of iron, one end of which was red hot, from the shop of a blacksmith, and thrust it furiously into the face of the lion. With a cry of pain and rage the lion left the princess and bounded off to the bazaars, where he did great damage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask? Was Ahmed rewarded for his bravery? What happened to the soap seller? Is that where the story ends? Well, to find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

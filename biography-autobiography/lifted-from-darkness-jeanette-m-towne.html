  <title>Lifted from Darkness - Jeanette M. Towne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Epic Transformation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from Living the Nightmare &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to Healing the Spirit... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On the outside, Jeanette had it all together; a good marriage, a beautiful daughter - poised on the threshold of a successful career. Behind the closed doors of a suburban prison, she continued to hide the shadowy secret of a splintered world of physical and mental torture. For over ten years, Jeanette was the pawn in a twisted psychological game, directed by the hands of the man whose lies she believed. She accepted the stark reality of never escaping alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she first met Jack, she was captured by his charming personality, wowed by his wealth, and quickly fell in love. What originated as protective, confident and dominant, cascaded into a traumatic web of physical and psychological violence, illustrating the intense complexities of love and fury, passion and brutality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this touching work of inspiration, Jeanette reveals the entangled suffering and sadistic manipulation experienced, living with erratic violence. She carries you with her through the climatic events that led to her escape from the chasm of fear and intimidation. Jeanette exposes the heartbreaking effects domestic violence played on her identity as she moved toward true healing and a life of personal fulfillment and success with a faithful trust in the God that never fails.&lt;/p&gt;" />

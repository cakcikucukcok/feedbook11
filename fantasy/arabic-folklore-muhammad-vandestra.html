  <title>Arabic Folklore - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am an ant, so of course, I know why Allah created us ants. But you know, I fail to understand why Allah created man.&lt;br /&gt;
I find it quite strange, even amazing, and sometimes irritating, to see a creature that walks carelessly and treads upon armies of ants. More than that, with his horse he destroys thousands of ants without sensing or feeling anything! He does such things without knowing ...without realizing &amp;#39;&amp;quot; without noticing &amp;#39;&amp;quot; without understanding and without feeling angry or sad.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you notice the harshness that is hidden somewhere in his carelessness?&lt;br /&gt;
We ants can carry a grain of rice for half a day. Our life is not easy. Sometimes we find a piece of sugar and the High Council of Specialists for Food Security holds a counsel, &amp;quot;There is a piece of sugar over there,&amp;quot; they might say.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where?&amp;quot; we would ask.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;At a distance of one thousand ant steps from the apple tree.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How many ants are required in order to bring it?&amp;quot; we ask.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ten thousand ants.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Gather an army of fifty thousand ants,&amp;quot; we say as we organize ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
We have good reasons for increasing the number of our armies.&lt;br /&gt;
The main reason is that man is so excessive in destroying us without reason or excuse. I am an ant and an ant is a very small thing; a small insect but at the same time, a complete being and our existence coincide with our nature and wisdom stands as an integral part of our character. The motto of our life is to be clear and straight to the point.&lt;br /&gt;
Although we are no larger more than two millimetres, Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful has compensated us for our minute size and weak body with the talent of organization, management and making meticulous calculations. We are very clever you know!&lt;br /&gt;
We are never taken by surprise. We believe in Allah&amp;#39;s fate and the destiny decreed by Him. We know that a cup of water can drown an army of ants, but our belief in Allah does not prevent us from making calculations, feasibility studies, researching and organizing and managing everything striving for wisdom and perfection. Furthermore, we understand that belief in Allah obligates us to do so, for the laws of the universe aloe not to be broken for anybody and no creature is to stray from its nature." />

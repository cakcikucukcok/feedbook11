  <title>Son of Gun in Cheek - Bill Pronzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;I could hardly wait to begin the investigation. Somehow, I firmly believed that (at last!) we were following a course that would clearly reveal &amp;#8212; &lt;I&gt;something&lt;/I&gt;!&quot; &amp;#8212; from &lt;I&gt;The Stingaree Murders&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&quot;The [police] men saluted in the darkness and stole away with furtive tread. They knew the anticlimax was at hand, and their satisfaction was unbounded.&quot; &amp;#8212; from &lt;I&gt;The Merrivale Mystery&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&quot;It beats the devil. It&#39;s diabolical. It&#39;s fiendish. It&#39;s just not right.&quot; &amp;#8212; from &lt;I&gt;The Palgrave Mummy&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;A humorous and good-natured study of alternative crime fiction, the Edgar Award-nominated &lt;I&gt;Gun in Cheek &lt;/I&gt;celebrated the neglected classics of substandard mystery writing. After years of additional research into comically awful literature, author Bill Pronzini returns with &lt;I&gt;Son of Gun in Cheek,&lt;/I&gt; a compendium of even more twisted treasures for connoisseurs of hideous prose. Pronzini&#39;s lively commentary offers background on each of the stories he cites, providing an informative survey of the genre and its writers,&amp;nbsp;crowned with hilarious excerpts. His lighthearted look at the best of the worst in crime fiction will amuse not only mystery buffs but also anyone with a taste for ham-handed drama.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

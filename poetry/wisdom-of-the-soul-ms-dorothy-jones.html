  <title>Wisdom of the Soul - Ms. Dorothy Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this book of poetry entitled &quot;Wisdom Of The Soul,&quot; is to attempt to strengthen and enlighten, not to judge nor condemn.  Its purpose also is to touch the lives, and to share in the encouragement of others and hopefully touching their hearts and saving of souls.
&lt;P&gt;
The author speaks out through her poetry for those who want and need to be heard.  Her desire is to reach the world of the needy, whether it be a spiritual need, natural need, emotional need or any or all of these factors.  She desire her poetry to be a positive orator conveying the fact that love, faith, hope and all goodness and truth overcomes hatred, fear, prejudice, and all wrong-doings, and evil intentions.
&lt;P&gt;
Through the writing of poetry, the author submerge deeply within herself going beyond her mind, but into her heart and soul emerging with the truths which convicted her to write with experience, strong conviction, and ardent passion for those who have been and still are victimized by various forms of conflicts and adversities in their lives.  She desire the words of her poetry to come forth pure and clean-edged; going beyond the surface, from depth to depth, and to be a blessing and beneficial to all.
&lt;P&gt;
The author continually attempt to instill in others through poetry the importance of living within the bounds of righteousness in order to inherit the kingdom of God, &quot;for unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;  She emphasize the fact that we need to get ourselves ready for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  We are living in the last time, and Jesus Christ is still extending his love and mercy toward mankind wanting all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.  We must put aside all ungodliness, and seek Gods face; putting him first in our lives.  
&lt;P&gt;
The author desires her poems to capture the suppressed emotions that ones are too shy, embarrassed, or intimidated to express openly for fear of retaliation from others.  We must not be afraid to speak out for truth and justice, fearing no man, who can only destroy our bodies, but fearing only God who can destroy both body and soul.
&lt;P&gt;
The author writes about life and about death.  She attest to the belief that our mortal lives should be lived to the fulliest daily in Gods way and after his will in order to obtain immortality and eternal life.  Thus death in the end shall have no dominion over Eternal Life, and there is hope beyond the grave; if we die in Christ Jesus.  
&lt;P&gt;
To fear the Lord Jesus, to grow in grace and knowledge of him, to love, to be pure and faithful and to do all things in spirit and in truth is to truly obtain spiritual wisdom." />

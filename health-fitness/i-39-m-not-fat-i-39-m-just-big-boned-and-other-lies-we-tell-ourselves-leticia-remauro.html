  <title>I&#39;m Not Fat, I&#39;m Just Big Boned and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves - Leticia Remauro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;When I first decided to write this book it was because I wanted to share my weight loss experience with others. I figured that if I could overcome a life long struggle with obesity then others could as well. I compiled all my tips in one place hoping that after people read them they would understand that weight loss is an achievable goal. The odd thing is, the more I wrote the more I realized that it wasnt a diet program alone that helped me to lose weight  it was the fact that I had finally stopped lying to myself about why I was fat in the first place.&quot;" />

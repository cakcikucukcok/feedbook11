  <title>Saving Childhood: How to Protect Your Children from the Na - Michael Medved, Diane Medved</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saving Childhood&lt;/em&gt; offers parents and grandparents practical strategies to cope with a society that seems perversely determined to frighten and corrupt its young. Cultural critic and popular radio host Michael Medved and his wife, psychologist Diane Medved, argue that in a mistaken effort to curb problems plaguing its youth, our culture has changed from protecting childhood as a precious time of growth to hammering even the smallest youngsters with a grim, harsh, and menacing view of the world. The Medveds systematically present unassailable scientific evidence, moving anecdotes, and personal experiences of raising their three young children to explain the attack from four primary directions--media, schools, peers, and even well-intentioned parents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a unique analysis the Medveds define innocence not as ignorance but as the result of three components--security, a sense of wonder and optimism. They empower parents and all who care about childhood with concrete, easily accomplished means to fend off the assault, as well as advice for handling hurdles such as the Internet, television, peer pressure, and the plague of pessimism. &lt;em&gt;Saving Childhood&lt;/em&gt; enables us to restore and maintain for our children imagination, confidence, and hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />

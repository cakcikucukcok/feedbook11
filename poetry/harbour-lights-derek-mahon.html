  <title>Harbour Lights - Derek Mahon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winner of the Irish Times/Poetry Now Award for Best Collection. When one of the ?nest contemporary poets produces a new collection containing some of his ?nest work our response is one of exhilaration and gratitude. The long, wide-ranging poems here (‘Resistance Days’, ‘Calypso’, ‘Harbour Lights’ itself) are interspersed with penetrating glances and a series of dazzling translations which enhance and extend their traditions; his version of ‘The Seaside Cemetery’ is a masterpiece. Together they form a book of rare organic unity and distinction. The author’s resolution to study ‘clouds and their formation’ and his concentration on ‘the real thing’ affirm aesthetic values in a violent time. Remembering ‘lives in a former life’ and celebrating ‘the redemptive power of women’, his work is unique in its verve and ?uency. Harbour Lights is an act of faith, and a triumph." />

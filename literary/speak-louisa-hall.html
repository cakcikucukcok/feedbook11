  <title>Speak - Louisa Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A thoughtful, poignant novel that explores the creation of Artificial Intelligence&amp;#8212;illuminating the very human need for communication, connection, and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a narrative that spans geography and time, from the Atlantic Ocean in the seventeenth century, to a correctional institute in Texas in the near future, and told from the perspectives of five very different characters, &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt; considers what it means to be human, and what it means to be less than fully alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young Puritan woman travels to the New World with her unwanted new husband. Alan Turing, the renowned mathematician and code breaker, writes letters to his best friend&amp;#8217;s mother. A Jewish refugee and professor of computer science struggles to reconnect with his increasingly detached wife. An isolated and traumatized young girl exchanges messages with an intelligent software program. A former Silicon Valley Wunderkind is imprisoned for creating illegal lifelike dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these characters is attempting to communicate across gaps&amp;#8212;to estranged spouses, lost friends, future readers, or a computer program that may or may not understand them. In dazzling and electrifying prose, Louisa Hall explores how the chasm between computer and human&amp;#8212;shrinking rapidly with today&amp;#8217;s technological advances&amp;#8212;echoes the gaps that exist between ordinary people. Though each speaks from a distinct place and moment in time, all five characters share the need to express themselves while simultaneously wondering if they will ever be heard, or understood.&lt;/p&gt;" />

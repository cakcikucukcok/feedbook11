      <meta name="description" content="The year was 2007 the Democratic and Republican National Committees had, after a great deal of behind the scenes negotiations and arm twisting, come to terms on the selection of their candidates for the office of the President of the United States. For the Parties a great deal was at stake. To the victor would go the spoils; and in America the spoils were unimaginably great. Campaign money was abundantly available, thrown about like water by the lobbyists for the special interest groups. Though each Party talked up what they stood for, and would spend hundreds of millions of dollars to convince the voters of this, the voters found no matter which Party was victorious little changed, all the campaign rhetoric seemingly forgotten. All the while America&#39;s greatness continued to slide downward, much in the way all past great empires had. Now faced with a serious downturn in the economy a growing level of dissent and restlessness was in the air, as an ever greater number of people were having difficulty getting by.

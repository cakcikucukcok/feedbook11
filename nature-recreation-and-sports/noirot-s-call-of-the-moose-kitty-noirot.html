CLARK ALWAYS MADE THE BEST OF A SITUATION BY CALMLY AND STRATEGICALLY PLANNING HOW TO ENSURE THAT HE HAD AN EXCELLENT TRIP.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; This book is clearly a window into Clark Noirots life as an avid outdoorsman!

Experience life from an earlier time in Americas history through Noirots eyes and words. This is truly an enjoyable book to read for this fisherman/hunter!&lt;br&gt; Mark T. Masicampo; Oceano, California&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; The literary style of Kittys book brings alive a simpler time in life  a good read for anyone that is an avid sportsman. She has captured her fathers life from childhood through his adulthood in a very picturesque style. Her words give a vivid accounting of the places that Clark has lived and hunted. A real treasure of a book!&lt;br&gt; Patsy Tobias, avid reader&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Born on a farm near Sparr, Michigan, in 1928, Clark Noirot always had a deep love for the great outdoors. As a child, he loved to fish and hunt, bagging his first rabbit at an early age. But it was the urge to fly a plane that culminated in his becoming a bush pilot, a profession that took him to some of the most beautiful places in North America. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noirots Call of the Moose is an extraordinary story of one mans lifelong love affair with nature from early childhood through the golden years of retirement. Filled with amusing anecdotes, snippets of nostalgia, and a good deal of wit, Noirots charming stories reveal how he created a career out of being an outdoorsman. Colorful characters infuse Noirots tale, and breathtaking descriptions of wildlife and of the Canadian wilderness create a magnificent backdrop. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From majestic moose and killer bugs to freezing nights and close encounters, Noirot paints a rich portrait of his life as a hunter, fisherman, conservationist, pilot, moose caller, and, above all, survivor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enjoy the experience of the Canadian wilderness as Noirot drinks from natural bubbling brooks, hunts, fishes, and relishes the clean, cool fresh air. Noirots Call of the Moose satisfies the nature lover in us all. &lt;/p&gt;" />

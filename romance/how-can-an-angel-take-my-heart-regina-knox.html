  <title>How Can an Angel Take My Heart? - Regina Knox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a work of fiction centering mainly on the experience of Angela (Angel) Lord in connection with her relationship with Kennedy (Kendy) Brooks.
After leaving her husband, Angel begins a life with her partner Tonya who lives with her and two children. While on a business trip to Arizona with her assistant, Kendy meets Angel in the restaurant where she was just been promoted to manager. Although Kendy is involved with a man named Robert who is waiting to propose marriage to her back in Boston, the two women hit it off and eventually become lovers. Hoping to portray his ex-wife in a negative light, Michael pays an associate to follow Angel and report back to him with any incriminating information. When Angel breaks the news of her feelings for Kendy to her former lover, Tonya vows revenge, and eventually joins forces with Michael to take Angels children away from her. When the love of her life lay in a coma, Angel tried the only thing she knew; the faith that Kennedy had been brought up with, since her father was a preacher. And by the time she recovered everything was different.
As the story progresses, Angel and Kendy must summon a source of internal strength to overcome the obstacles that their new relationship seems to create." />

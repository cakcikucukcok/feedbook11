  <title>Black Clouds - Linda Haynes, Pritchard Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her memoir, &lt;i&gt;Black Clouds&lt;/i&gt;, author Linda Leigh Haynes Pritchard Leonard tells the story of the life challenges she has faced. More than anything, it is a journey into Gods care, revealing how He works in the lives of innocent children and people who put their trust in Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early years of Leighs abuse and abandonment, God sheltered her from the fiery darts of those who would harm her. He prevented her from realizing that her life was any different from those of her schoolmates. From being abandoned as a child to dealing with her adult life as she faced life-or-death situations, God has always been with her. She has dealt with alcohol abuse, the destruction of her home through fire, and a tortuous relationship with her biological mother. Through all of her personal challenges, God has surrounded her with His love and with angels to carry her through it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Leigh and her husband sought Gods grace and the love He holds for all of His children. They overcame many trials, much tribulation, abuse, rejection, and abandonment and have survived through Gods unconditional love. Leighs resilience and the ever-present hand of God is evident as she bravely recounts in vivid, inspiring language the traumas and tragedies she experienced throughout her life. Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;Black Clouds&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one womans survival through her strong faith in God and supportive family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Youssef not only captured his nation&amp;#8217;s dissent but stamped it with his own brand of humorous political criticism, in which the Egyptian government became the prime laughing stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So potent were Youssef&amp;#8217;s skits, jokes, and commentary, the authoritarian government accused him of insulting the Egyptian presidency and Islam. After a six-hour long police interrogation, Youssef was released. While his case was eventually dismissed, his television show was terminated, and Youssef, fearful for his safety, fled his homeland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Revolution for Dummies&lt;/em&gt;, Youssef recounts his life and offers hysterical riffs on the hypocrisy, instability, and corruption that has long animated Egyptian politics. From the attempted cover-up of the violent clashes in Tahrir Square to the government&amp;#8217;s announcement that it had created the world&amp;#8217;s first &quot;AIDS cure&quot; machine, to the conviction of officials that Youssef was a CIA operative&amp;#8212;recruited by Jon Stewart&amp;#8212;to bring down the country through sarcasm. There&amp;#8217;s much more&amp;#8212;and it&amp;#8217;s all insanely true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interweaving the dramatic and inspiring stories of the development of his popular television show and his rise as the most contentious funny-man in Egypt, Youssef&amp;#8217;s humorous, fast-paced takes on dictatorship, revolution, and the unforeseeable destiny of democracy in the Modern Middle East offers much needed hope and more than a few healing laughs. A documentary about his life, &lt;em&gt;Tickling Giants&lt;/em&gt;, debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2016,&amp;#160;and is now&amp;#160;scheduled for major release. &lt;/p&gt;" />

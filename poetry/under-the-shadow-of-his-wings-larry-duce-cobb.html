  <title>Under the Shadow of His Wings - Larry Duce Cobb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Mr. Cobb does an exceptional job in simplifying the complexity of lifes lessons.  From personal experiences, frequent spiritual awakenings, quick wittedness and shrewdness throughout his writing. 
This book has much to acclaim it by way of worth, quality and depth.  It shows that Mr. Cobb was consistent in communicating details having more to offer than merely dry composed words.
It shows deep feelings, emotions and points of view in a rhythmic form.  His choice of words is not to make them rhyme but to freely flow.
It is with this in mind that I invite you to read and enjoy this awesome publication by Mr. Larry Duce Cobb.  Get comfortable, prepare yourself for a pleasurable feast for the mind and learn from lifes experiences as coming from the words of this great author/poet/survivor and man of God.
I ask, waiting for an answer, I knock, praying its heard, I seek, hoping to find the promises of God on time

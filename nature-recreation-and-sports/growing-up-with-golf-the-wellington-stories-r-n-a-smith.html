  <title>Growing up with Golf: the Wellington Stories - R.N.A. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing Up With Golf, subtitled The Wellington Stories, follows young Wellington and friend Finley for nine years of their golfing lives.  This nine-story collection commences with the boys&#39; first stabbing swings.  By book&#39;s end, these buddies are driving cars as well as golf balls, and their friendship has been through more than one seemingly unplayable lie.  Among the hazards faced by Wellie and Fin are little brothers, big girls, crude cousins, parental love, and, of course, golf&#39;s thorny spells.  
There&#39;s much to be learned here by golfing &quot;children&quot; of any age.  The stories hinge on timeless golf dilemmas, making Wellie and Fin more than just a cute twosome who swear a tad.  With a sure sense of golfing psychology, the author has chipped in earthy chunks of our game&#39;s natural humor, rendering each tale a satisfying whole." />

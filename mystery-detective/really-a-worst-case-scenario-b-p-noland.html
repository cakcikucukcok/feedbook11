  <title>Really, a Worst-Case Scenario - B. P. Noland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mayor Ron Steadman of Centerville, New Mexico, is ready for reelection. The campaign has been running smoothly, no question. No opponent stands a chance against this powerful community leader. The election is only a month away, and the desert skies couldnt be bluerthat is until theres a murder, and Rons wife, Val, becomes the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valarie Steadman is a scientist and university laboratory director for stem cell research, but shes not a murderer. Someone has set her up, but she wonders whether the perpetrator is out to ruin heror her husband. She enlists the help of lab assistant Steve Janson to help her solve the crime and clear her name. Meanwhile, the mayorwho happens to be an ex-FBI agentjoins forces with the local homicide detective, Joe Maxwell, to do a little investigation of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, Ron and Joe find themselves near the border of Mexico, where a drug cartel that might be tied to the murder gets involved. When the FBI and DEA join the fray, things get even more complicated. Its a good thing Ron is a politician; he knows how to change complicated into simple. Still, his time is running out. If hes lucky, he can get reelected and save the life of the woman he loves.&lt;/p&gt;" />

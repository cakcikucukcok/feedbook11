  <title>Choices Are for the Living - Michele Davenport</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Choices Are For The Living is a spiritual journey every believer should take.  It begins with one simple yet profound question...Do we fear the Lord?  In other words, do we have a reverential awe of the Most High God?  As Christians, a positive response comes easily, but our true answer is always reflected in our choices.  This is not a legalistic or works-based theology.  Instead, its an authentic, heartfelt, crazy in love faith response to Christ Himself. Led by the Spirit, Michele challenges us to ask some hard questions.  Are we willing to uncompromisingly obey the Word of God at all costs?  Will we follow the Holy Spirit no matter where He leads?  Do our words say Yes while our choices scream No?  This message is a wake-up call for the church.  Its time we choose commitment over complacency, action over apathy and passion over passivity.  Allow the Spirit to use this anointed, inspired book to spark in you a reverent fear of Almighty God.  Refuse to live a single day as a lukewarm Christian.  Be willing to make choices with eternal significance...and be ready to turn your world upside down for Jesus!

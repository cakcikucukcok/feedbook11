  <title>The Gifts We Can Afford to Give Our Children - Patti Blamire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What does it take to become a teacher, a nurse, an accountant or a plumber? It takes a few years of study and/or apprenticeship. Being educated for our chosen career gives one the knowledge and confidence to succeed in that vocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it take to become a parent...usually little more than a few moments of pleasure? Which education system prepares us for our role as parents? I believe that being a Mom or a Dad is THE most important career assignment we will ever be given and yet we receive little or no preparation for this life-long task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, parents produced many children in order to compliment their challenging work load. Today however, most parents would like to give their children more than what they themselves have had; they also want them to have a happy and comfortable childhood and then they envision success, fulfillment and happiness for their offspring in their adult lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you thought of how you would go about assisting your child to achieve these milestones of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gifts you can Afford to give your Children&lt;/strong&gt; offers some thoughts on subjects such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gift of Creativity  how to help your child find the creativity within himself;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gift of Honesty and Integrity  the value of living a truth-filled life;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gift of Humour  finding and enjoying the lighter side of life together as a family;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gift of Self-worth and Confidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also looks at finding the Light within ourselves and our children  the gentle vibration within every living cell in our Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It proposes a deeper, more satisfying and creative approach to raising childrena conscious and thoughtful way of exploring parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;

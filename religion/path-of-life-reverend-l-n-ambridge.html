  <title>Path of Life - Reverend L. N. Ambridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I finally made the right decision and accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and&lt;br /&gt;Saviour, I was sure I was on the right path. Then I began to meet church people.&lt;br /&gt;Thats when the confusion started. It seemed like they all called themselves something&lt;br /&gt;different. Some people were Christians. Some people were believers.&lt;br /&gt;Some people were born again. Some people were saved. I was baffl ed. What&lt;br /&gt;was I? What category did I fi t into? Did each of these names have a different&lt;br /&gt;method; did each one follow a different path? I didnt know what category I&lt;br /&gt;fi t into and after a while I wasnt sure if I fit into any category, because no one&lt;br /&gt;seemed to agree on what they all meant. I kept fi nding different interpretations&lt;br /&gt;of what I thought was the truth. I know that God is not the author of confusion.&lt;br /&gt;So I started to pray. I started asking God for the answer. I have learned one thing.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of what we call ourselves or how we interpret it or apply it, there is&lt;br /&gt;only one Truth. Regardless of the route we think we have to take to reach Heaven,&lt;br /&gt;there is only one path for a Christian; that is the Path of Life. There is only one&lt;br /&gt;roadmap for a born again believer...that is the Word of God, the Bible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

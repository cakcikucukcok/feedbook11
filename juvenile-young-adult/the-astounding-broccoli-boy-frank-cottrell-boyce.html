  <title>The Astounding Broccoli Boy - Frank Cottrell Boyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Frank Cottrell Boyce&amp;#8212;the beloved, award-winning, New York Times&amp;#8211;bestselling author of Millions and Cosmic&amp;#8212;comes another hilarious, heartbreaking, and completely original middle grade novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rory Rooney likes to be prepared for anything. That sort of planning pays off when you&amp;#8217;re the smallest kid in your class. Rory is even prepared (mostly) for Tommy-Lee, his nemesis, who starts most days by throwing Rory out of the back of the school bus. &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be scared&lt;/em&gt;, his favorite book says, &lt;em&gt;be prepared&lt;/em&gt;. And Rory aims to be. What&amp;#8217;s more heroic than that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rory &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; prepared when he suddenly and inexplicably turns green and finds himself stuck in an experimental hospital ward. The doctors are just as baffled as Rory is, and that&amp;#8217;s when he begins to wonder: What if this isn&amp;#8217;t caused by his genes, or a virus, or something he ate? What if it&amp;#8217;s something even more extraordinary? After all, more than a few superheroes&amp;#8217; careers began when they turned green. Could this be a sign that he&amp;#8217;s meant for something greater? Rory is going to find out&amp;#8212;and that&amp;#8217;s going to start with escaping from the hospital.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />

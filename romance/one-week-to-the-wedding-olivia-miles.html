  <title>One Week to the Wedding - Olivia Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In the vein of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors Susan Mallery and Kristan Higgins comes a women&#39;s fiction novel about moving forward and mending relationships after two sisters are torn apart by a devastating betrayal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lately, just thinking about gowns and centerpieces makes her want to hide under the covers with her dog and a good book --one that doesn&#39;t include a romantic plot, thank you very much. Maybe it&#39;s because her fiance cheated. Or maybe it&#39;s because he cheated with her younger sister, Charlotte. Or maybe it&#39;s because her newfound reputation as jilted wedding planner isn&#39;t exactly doing wonders for her career. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Charlotte knows she messed up. Big time. But she also knows something Kate doesn&#39;t-something that might bring them close again, if her sister will ever take her calls. But as time passes and silence grows, Charlotte begins to realize she can&#39;t hide from her problems forever, and that sometimes the only place to run is home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  With the wedding only a week away, Kate expects a few surprises. But what she doesn&#39;t expect is to find herself believing...in the strength of family, and the possibility of finding love again. &lt;br&gt;" />

  <title>Sixty-Five Years of Four-Legged Friends - Robert G. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have tried many things in my working years: steel worker, sweeper sales, campground
owner, auto salvage yard operator, owner of an air compressor sales and service company, and
owner of a miscellaneous metals center. I retired and sold everything. A year into retirement I
volunteered to help with a project at church and found myself agreeing to take on the church
maintenance, which lasted for four years.
I have always had a more than passing interest in the arts. Over the years Ive worked with
wood, copper, iron, steel, and in my spare time I painted, mostly outdoor scenes with
acrylics. Then I discovered glass etching.
In my early years, the everyday work of providing for and raising a family didnt leave a lot
of time for serious commitment to my artworks, but since my second retirement I have been
able to fl y.
Ive etched sixteen windows for St. Anthony Catholic Church, Brooksville, FL; ten windows
for The Florida Medical Center, Springhill, FL; six doors for St. Thomas Catholic Church,
Homosassa, FL. I have works in restaurants, attorneys offi ces and many homes including
that of Architect Hal Lenox.

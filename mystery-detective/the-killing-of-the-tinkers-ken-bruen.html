  <title>The Killing of the Tinkers - Ken Bruen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jack Taylor blew town at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Guards&lt;/i&gt; his alcoholism was a distant memory and sober dreams of a new life in London were shining in his eyes. In the opening pages of &lt;i&gt;The Killing of the Tinkers&lt;/i&gt;, Jack&#39;s back in Galway a year later with a new leather jacket on his back, a pack of smokes in his pocket, a few grams of coke in his waistband, and a pint of Guinness on his mind. So much for new beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long he&#39;s sunk into his old patterns, lifting his head from the bar only every few days, appraising his surroundings for mere minutes and then descending deep into the alcoholic, drug-induced fugue he prefers to the real world. But a big gypsy walks into the bar one day during a moment of Jack&#39;s clarity and changes all that with a simple request. Jack knows the look in this man&#39;s eyes, a look of hopelessness mixed with resolve topped off with a quietly simmering rage; he&#39;s seen it in the mirror. Recognizing a kindred soul, Jack agrees to help him, knowing but not admitting that getting involved is going to lead to more bad than good. But in Jack Taylor&#39;s world bad and good are part and parcel of the same lost cause, and besides, no one ever accused Jack of having good sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Bruen wowed critics and readers alike when he introduced Jack Taylor in &lt;i&gt;The Guards&lt;/i&gt;; he&#39;ll blow them away with &lt;i&gt;The Killing of the Tinkers&lt;/i&gt;, a novel of gritty brilliance that cements Bruen&#39;s place among the greats of modern crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />

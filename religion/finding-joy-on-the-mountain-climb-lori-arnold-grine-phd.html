  <title>Finding Joy on the Mountain Climb - Lori Arnold-Grine PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living with chronic illness can make life seem like a steep mountain climb. How do you find the strength to climb on and face each day with pain and suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding Joy on the Mountain Climb is a story of encouragement and hope, enriched with scripture and prayer. Written during a chronic illness battle, Arnold-Grine shares how a deep personal relationship with God helped her take One Step at a Time. She also includes 40 days of inspirational devotions from her health blog to help find purpose, peace and comfort in the battle. Discover how God will carry you through a struggle and equip you for the climb in her testimony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day with chronic illness I must take up my cross and follow where God leads me up this mountain. My hand is in His - the only way I want to travel this difficult journey. It has brought me to a deeper relationship with God, and through it I wish to share my story of hope and offer encouragement to others. The focus is not on the mountain climb, but on the Lord getting me to the summit to praise Him and finding joy in the journey by leaning heavily on Him. Inspired by Psalm 46:10 Be still and know that I am God, I take one step at a time with Him. It is within the battle that we find ourselves committed to what matters most. As I lean not on my own understanding, God offers peace and light to pave my pathway. He gives strength for the journey and carries me. Give me Jesus for the journey, and as I walk closely with Him, may He bless others through me. It is my prayer that this story encourages others to praise God on the mountain climb.&lt;/p&gt;" />

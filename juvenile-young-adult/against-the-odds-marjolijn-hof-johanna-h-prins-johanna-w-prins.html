  <title>Against the Odds - Marjolijn Hof, Johanna H. Prins, Johanna W. Prins</title>

&lt;p&gt;Kiki lives with her mother and father and their very old fat dog, Mona. Life is good except that Kiki&#39;s father, a doctor, feels compelled to go off on missions to dangerous and faraway war zones. No matter how persuasive her arguments, Kiki cannot convince him to stay home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiki&#39;s mother explains to her about odds &amp;#8212; how it is very unlikely that her father will die because, after all, how many of her friends&#39; fathers have died? The odds are very good it won&#39;t happen. When her father actually does go missing, and as her mother and grandmother get more and more upset, Kiki begins to feel that it&#39;s up to her to save him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This award-winning book deals with big moral issues in a serious way, but it is also very funny and deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;" />

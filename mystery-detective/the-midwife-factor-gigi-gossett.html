  <title>The Midwife Factor - GiGi Gossett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Only a kindly midwife knows that Nicola Moldovan, a fifteen-year-old Romanian teenager living in Cincinnati, gave birth to identical twin girls nineteen years ago. The twins, separated at birth, have grown up on different continents, unwittingly sharing thoughts, feelings, and dreams with each other without any idea they are sisters. But just as the now elderly midwife, Flossie Walker, decides to pen a tell-all letter to the families involved, a sinister plot unfolds in a Budapest prison.
Morgan Wellington, the adopted daughter of a Nobel Prize winning physician and his wife, has always secretly yearned to know her true biological identityeven more so after her Hungarian roommate tells her about a look-alike in Budapest and invites her to visit the country to see for herself. Meanwhile, Morgans parents, curious as to why their daughter has spontaneously traveled to Budapest, hire private investigator Lynn Davis to discover the truth. While Lynn tries to make sense of several perplexing scenarios, a habitual criminal puts the final touches on an evil plan that will change everything.
In this international mystery, past secrets are revealed as two girls separated at birth attempt to find their way back to each other, with the help of a private investigator and the midwife who brought  them into the world." />

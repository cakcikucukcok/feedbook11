  <title>Taking Eve - Iris Johansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Iris Johansen is back with the first book in a chilling new Eve Duncan trilogy that asks the question: will Eve survive what lies ahead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan&#39;s mission is to bring closure to the families whose loved ones have vanished.  She knows their anguish--her own beloved daughter, Bonnie, was taken from her when Bonnie was just seven years old.  It is only recently that this mystery was resolved and Eve could begin her journey to peace.  Now, Jim Doane wants the same kind of answers that Eve always longed for.  His twenty-five-year old son may or may not be dead and he has only burned skull fragments as possible evidence.  But he cannot go to the police for answers without risking his own secrets and dark past, so instead he chooses a bold step to find the truth--a truth that takes Eve down a twisted path of madness and evil and into the darkest heart of her own history.  Doane needs Eve Duncan&#39;s skills and he&#39;ll do anything to get them.  &lt;br&gt;Even if it means &lt;i&gt;taking Eve. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

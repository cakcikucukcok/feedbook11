  <title>Commoner&#39;s Speech - Enoch Ojotisa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These poems are simply written about the political, educational and social spheres in my country, Nigeria. I am a Pan African Socialist as I stated in the introduction. I believe in the united idea and zeal of the people. Moreover, the African culture believes in the tradition of poetry which in my own tribe (Yoruba), are known as RARA, IJALA SISUN and others. And this is the chief basis why I opted for the device of poetry, as a means of raising consciousness amongst the masses about the problems of our government. It must be noted, that the masses here, refer to the working class in the country. As a socialist, I believe in the idea of having a drive might of the labor governance. Our leaders in my country have done no good to the youths. Sound education is only a dream to the children of the poor; while it is earned only by the children of the rich; mostly outside the country." />

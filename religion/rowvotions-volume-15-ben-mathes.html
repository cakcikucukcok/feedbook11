  <title>Rowvotions Volume 15 - Ben Mathes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to serve; realizing that it is their country, their people, their village, but our problem. We will never do for others what they can do for themselves, but will work in a partnership based upon mutual love, grace, and respect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Dr. Ben Mathes, president, Rivers of the World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rivers of the World (ROW) is a not-for-profit Christian ministry that targets remote river basins. Our goal is to serve with people who live in these river basins and those we serve determine our projects. We ask them what makes up their greatest challenges and covenant with them to meet and overcome those challenges together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ROW emphasizes that it is their country, their village, their culture, but our problem. Our goal is to serve in an atmosphere of mutual concern and respect. ROW projects run the gamut of human, physical and spiritual needs. Academics, research, education and medical/dental concerns go hand-in-hand with church planting, construction, evangelism and Bible distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Dr. Ben Mathes&lt;/b&gt; is president of Rivers of the World (ROW), an international exploration and development agency, based in Dawsonville, Ga. To learn more about ROW, please visit www.row.org. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karin M. Clack&lt;/b&gt; is a freelance writer who has worked for Rivers of the World (ROW) since May 2006. She resides in Colorado Springs, Co. To read more uplifting and encouraging devotions, please visit our ROW blog page at www.row.org/rowvotions. &lt;/p&gt;

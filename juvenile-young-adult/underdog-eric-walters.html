There is no free ride on Coach Barkley&#39;s team. The tryouts are tough but fair and it looks like the nucleus of last yearís team will be together once again. But there is one new player who seems to have the skills to impress the coach. Though Ashton has great skills, he&#39;s not much of a team player.

  <title>Go Down Moses - Moses Mason Ii, JoAnn Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1973, God told Apostle Moses Mason, just as he had told Abraham get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house, unto a land that I will show thee. (Gen. 12:1) Following the path that God had chosen for his life, Moses Mason was changed. He received the operation of the Five Fold Ministry.  A trailblazer for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, many souls have been delivered through the power of God. He is recognized as a great man of faith and power for these last day movements of God.  In his story, you will find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o	A road map to a successful ministry in evangelism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o	Memorable experiences in the field as an evangelist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o	Teaching of faith and how to operate in the Spirit of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moses Mason is an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ and a newly ordained bishop in the Church of God in Christ International. A native of Berkeley California, Mr. Mason graduated from Berkeley High School and Merritt College before joining the United States Army. He earned a Masters of Theology from the New Theological Seminary and a Doctorate in Philosophy and Theology. He also received an honorary doctorate from St. Thomas Theological Seminary. He traveled throughout the United States for 40 years preaching, teaching the yoke-breaking Word of healing and deliverance. He has been on many radio broadcasting stations in the U.S. and overseas. Dr. Mason has pastored several churches including the Last Day Harvest Church of God in Christ International. He resided in Nashville, TN, and conducted Crusades for God. He was married to his wife JoAnn for over 43 years. Together they have eight sons and five daughters, thirteen beautiful and gifted children. This is a true story of events that took place in his life. A faith-walk, journey, and ministry which allowed him to be a trailblazer and groundbreaker for God. Apostle Moses Mason went home to be with the Lord on October 30, 2015. May God always bless the work of his hands.  To God be the Glory for the things he did in Apostle Moses Masons life!&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Dream Travel - Jennie Abito-Carlestav, Paolo Ertreo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine if children were able to calm their mind. Perform guided imagery to your child through this heartwarming childrens story of Max and his adventures. 
Dream Travel entertains the idea of two best friends reuniting. Join Max as he travels to Saturn and meets Noah, the alien who happens to be his best friend in their previous life together. Max&#39;s adventure in Dream Travel is the first book in the series A Story for Intuitive Kids that aims to entertain and provide guidance to children and their parents on the unique life of an intuitive child.
Dream Travel, a heartwarming childrens story of Max and his alien counterpart, is a must read for parents and their intuitive kids. Jennie Abito-Carlestav, a California Therapist and Board of Directors for the California Association of Marriage &amp; Family Therapist San Diego Chapter, has written a book that will open up your thoughts and minds to all that one can imagine, and in doing so entertain both young and old. This is a book that I highly recommend.

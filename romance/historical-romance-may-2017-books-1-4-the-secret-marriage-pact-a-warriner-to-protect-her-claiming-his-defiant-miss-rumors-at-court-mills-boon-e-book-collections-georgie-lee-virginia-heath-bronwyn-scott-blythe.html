        &lt;h2&gt;Four historical romances to transport you in time!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Marriage Pact&lt;/em&gt; by Georgie Lee&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An improper proposal!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jane Rathbone is used to being left behind, and no longer believes she deserves happiness. But when childhood friend Jasper Charton returns from the Americas, more dangerously sexy than ever, she has a proposition. She&#39;ll give him the property he needs if he&#39;ll give her a new future–by marrying her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jasper never imagined taking a wife, but wonders if loyal Jane could be his redemption. And when their marriage brings tantalizing pleasures, convenient vows blossom into a connection that could heal them both…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Warriner to Protect Her&lt;/em&gt; by Virginia Heath&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An heiress in distress and an earl in disgrace…&lt;br /&gt;When heiress Violet Dunston escapes from an abduction, she finds an unlikely protector in Jack Warriner–a member of one of England&#39;s most infamous families. Ensconced with mysterious Jack behind his manor&#39;s walls, soon escape is the last thing on Letty&#39;s mind!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jack may be an earl, but his father&#39;s exploits have left him with nothing to offer except a tarnished name. He&#39;s turned his back on the ton, but with Letty tempting him day and night, he finds himself contemplating the unthinkable–a society marriage!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claiming His Defiant Miss&lt;/em&gt; by Bronwyn Scott&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seduced by her bodyguard!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aristocrat&#39;s daughter May Worth is beautiful, headstrong…and in trouble. There&#39;s only one man who can protect her: Liam Casek, her brother&#39;s best friend, a government agent and the man whose sinfully seductive touch she&#39;s never forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rakish Liam always knew May&#39;s wild beauty would be the death of him, but if he&#39;s to protect her with his life, he&#39;s damned if he&#39;ll deny their still-sizzling chemistry! May is everything Liam wants–if only he dares claim this defiant miss for his own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rumours at Court&lt;/em&gt; by Blythe Gifford &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wed by royal command!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widow Valerie of Florham wants nothing more than to forget her abusive marriage and live peacefully at the mercy of no man. She’d never have dreamed of a liaison with handsome Sir Gil Wolford, but then comes a royal decree…they must wed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gil craves military conquest in Castile, far from his haunted past. Marriage to Lady Valerie is the last thing he should want, yet both have truths to hide from the rumour-mongers at court. They have no choice…and, once wed, the marriage bed changes everything!&lt;/p&gt;

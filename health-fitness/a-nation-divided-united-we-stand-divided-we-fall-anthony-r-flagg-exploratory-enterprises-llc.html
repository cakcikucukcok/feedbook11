By dissecting and addressing fallacies amongst mainstream media, and the global elitist&amp;rsquo;s agenda, we will find clarity and truth as we prepare to reestablish our Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With this time of restoration before restriction, we will restore the foundations of Truth and Love, presently eroded by division and deception, rescuing as many souls that will salvation as possible. We will examine the redefining of meaning and the deception tactics deployed to reshape our conscious, unconscious and subconscious states of mind, gaining awareness through many complex truths. The multitudes of which will have meaning and hope for every living, breathing person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In totality, we will review the record of what has taken place before a Trump Administration, preparing ourselves and country before the mainstream media confusion-chaos-fest escalates. By correcting fallacies spread to divide us amongst each other - through a systematic review of truth, historical facts, past &amp;amp; present issues, and a deep analysis of our division - we will &amp;lsquo;Set the Record Straight&amp;rsquo; on where we have been and the &amp;ldquo;total reset&amp;rdquo; we avoided with Common Grace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We must unify together to uproot the destructive worldly forces that seek power, control, and wealth at each of our expenses, supporting the man, the movement &amp;amp; the 45th President of the United States of America - God&amp;#39;s anointed Cyrus (Isaiah 45) - Donald J.

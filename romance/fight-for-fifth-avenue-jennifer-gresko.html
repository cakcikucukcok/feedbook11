      <meta name="description" content="As far as fairy tales go, life hasn&#39;t exactly lived up to the glamorous dreams Emmie had for herself. After a break-up that won&#39;t seem to end, business schemes that just don&#39;t pan out and trying to find time to fall in love with the man of her dreams, she is ready to call it quits. She doesn&#39;t know if she is cracked up for the crazy life of a city girl. Is it worth all the hassle? Is love worth the fight? And when a man from her former life shows up unexpectedly, will she give it all up and run back home, or will she fight for the happy ending she has always dreamed of?" />

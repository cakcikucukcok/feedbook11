  <title>Eight Years in an Orphanage - Jerry M Drumm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true real life story of how a young boy seven years old was uprooted from his familiar surroundings and placed in an orphanage at Barium Springs, NC. He stayed at the orphanage until he ran away when he was fifteen years old. He had to learn at an early age how to cope with a new way of life. That way of life included being separated from his brother, who was also placed in the orphanage at the age of three. Very seldom did he get to see his brother, even though they were only yards away from each other. At age ten, he was working on a truck farm. As his years progressed at Barium Springs, he was taught how a young boy could grow into a hard working, caring, loving young man." />

  <title>Amsterdam Angel - Jason Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brothers Jason and Joe grow up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, within a magical backyard of safety, comfort, and love. But when Joe is killed in a car accident just before Jason graduates from college, his idyllic world suddenly crumbles around him. As Jason and his family rely on their Catholic faith to help them through the unfathomable loss, no one has any idea that for years, Jason has been harboring a secret: he is gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his youthful sense of immortality deeply shaken with Joes death, Jason embarks on a journey of self-discovery after college graduation that leads him across Europe with the hope he can discover a new perspective on life, death, and living with loss. Even as he battles a seemingly endless internal struggle between the strict teachings from his Catholic faith and his overwhelming desire to live his life as a gay man, Jason continues to press on, realizing that his happiness depends on his determination to find the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam Angel is the compelling tale of one mans life-changing adventure across three continents in search of peace, love, and most importantly, his true self.&lt;/p&gt;" />

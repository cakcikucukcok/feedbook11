  <title>I Was There the Night He Died - Ray Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#147;Ray Robertson is an irrepressible voice, with brass balls, and a heart of gold. &lt;I&gt;I Was There the Night He Died&lt;/I&gt; is a hilarious, moving, insightful, and timely piece of modern realism, delightfully void of literary pretension. Here, at last, is a novel that rocks and rolls.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Jonathan Evison, author of &lt;I&gt;The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;So,&amp;#8221; she says. &amp;#147;Who died tonight?&amp;#8221;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sam Samson, meet Samantha. Sam&amp;#8217;s a novelist: his dad has Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s, his mother died of stroke, his wife was killed seventeen months ago in a car crash. Samantha, eighteen, is a cutter. She lives across the street from Sam&amp;#8217;s parents&amp;#8217; house. Marijuana and loneliness spark an unlikely friendship, which Sam finds hard to navigate, especially as his dad&amp;#8217;s condition worsens and the money for his care suddenly vanishes. Yet somehow, between a record player and a park bench, through late-night conversations about the deaths of Sam&amp;#8217;s musical heroes, and ultimately through each other, Sam and Samantha learn to endure the things they fear most.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Starring a 40-something writer who stumbles through the small town he thought he&amp;#8217;d left behind forever, and a marooned teenager who wishes she were anywhere else, &lt;I&gt;I Was There The Night He Died&lt;/I&gt; is a saucy, swaggering look at loss, love, and the redeeming power of music in the twenty-first century.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Praise for Ray Robertson,&lt;BR&gt;A Women&amp;#8217;s National Book Association Great Group Reads Author, 2013&lt;BR&gt;Shortlisted for the Hilary Weston Prize, 2011&lt;BR&gt;and the Trillium Prize, 2008&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Ray Robertson is the Jerry Lee Lewis of North American Letters.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#151;Chuck Kinder, author of &lt;I&gt;Honeymooners&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Both playful and profound, laced with insight from music to history, politics to literature, high to low culture.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;National Post&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Robertson&#39;s art is as character-driven as Mordecai Richler&#39;s &amp;#133; he wants us all to behave better and doesn&#39;t care who he angers along the way.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Farm Boy Comes to the City - Herman Witt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After having had the disire to a write a book on my life for years but felt I should wait for
the right time. I had no writing experience or special ability in writing skills. English wasn&#39;t one of my strong points in school, and my computor skills were limited. One thing I did know and leaned on very strongly and that was, with God all things are possible.
So in Dec. 2010 I felt the time had come where I should go ahead with the project which I did. Looking back now on how well it went I believe the Lord wanted me to write this book and give Him the Honor and Glory for having helped me to make this a success. I had a strong desire to thank Him for what He has done in my journey in life. So as you read or have read remember that I could not have succeeded without the Lord&#39;s help. So this can apply to your life as well.
God Bless." />

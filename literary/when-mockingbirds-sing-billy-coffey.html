  <title>When Mockingbirds Sing - Billy Coffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billy Coffey has been compared to both Flannery O&#39;Connor and Shirley Jackson. Journey with him to Mattingly, VA, and discover what marks the boundary between a miracle from God and the imagination of a child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah is a child from Away, isolated from her peers because of her stutter. But then she begins painting scenes that are epic in scope, brilliant in detail, and suffused with rich, prophetic imagery. When the event foreshadowed in the first painting dramatically comes true, the town of Mattingly takes notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah attributes her ability to foretell the future to an invisible friend she calls the Rainbow Man. Some of the townsfolk are enchanted with her. Others fear her. But there is one thing they all agree on&amp;mdash;there is no such thing as the Rainbow Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father, the town psychologist, is falling apart over his inability to heal his daughter . . . or fix his marriage. And the town minister is unraveled by the notion that a mere child with no formal training may be hearing from God more clearly than he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the town bickers over what to do with this strange child, the content of Leah&amp;rsquo;s paintings grows darker. Still, Leah insists that the Rainbow Man&amp;rsquo;s heart is pure. But then a dramatic and tragic turn of events leaves the town reeling and places everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives in danger. Now the people of Mattingly face a single choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will they cling to what they know . . . or embrace the things Leah believes in that cannot be seen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Billy Coffey is one of the most lyrical writers of our time . . . we leave his imaginary world hungry for more, eager for another serving of Coffey&#39;s tremendous talent.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Julie Cantrell, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Into the Free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Includes a sneak peek at Coffey&#39;s new novel &lt;/em&gt;The Curse of Crow Hollow.&lt;/p&gt;" />

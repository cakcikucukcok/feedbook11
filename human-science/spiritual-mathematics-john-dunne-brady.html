  <title>Spiritual Mathematics - John Dunne-Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book opened an entirely new vista for organizing and using basic numbers. It investigated standard linear numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ....), and how they adversely affected our thinking and actions. It carefully described a circular number system, in which numbers were placed on concentric circles, rather than on straight lines. This new arrangement might very differently and beneficially affect our daily thought processes and activities. The key discovery involved a series of ten mandalas (circular patterns) made from everyday numbers. The book correlated these new breakthroughs with ancient spiritual patterns and practices found in the I Ching, Yoga, Kabala, and in both Pagan and Christian mysteries. These older teachings included the chakras, tree of life, tarot cards, and sacraments. Spiritual Mathematics gave a scientific explanation for many spiritual values and sacred phenomena. It also emphasized the underlying spiritual realities encountered within modern scientific dogmas." />

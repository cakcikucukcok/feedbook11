  <title>Wait Until Tuesday - John M. Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you could save a life, even in death? What if a part of you could live on and give a new lifea new heartbeatto another person in need? Organ donation is this ultimate gift of life, and for one man and his family, waiting for this miracle gift would be a lesson in life, faith, and hope.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Wait until Tuesday, author John M. Garrett shares his compelling story of waiting for a heart transplant while trying not to die. After a series of close calls, John is finally told he needs a heart transplant, but he is made aware of the fate of many awaiting transplantationthat there is a serious shortage of organs, and many die before their gift can arrive. But also a story of never giving up, Wait until Tuesday offers a window into the mind of a man fighting to stay present and strong for both himself and his family. His perseverance and his eventual gift of life would not only give him a second chance, but it would also give the world an advocate for the miracle of organ donation and transplantation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though a great majority of adults are in favor of organ donation and transplantation, only 2 percent of those who die become organ donors due to a fear, health factors, age, and other unknowns. Explore this personal chronicle of one mans gift of life and all the courage, faith, and support it takes to make the miracle of transplantation possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />

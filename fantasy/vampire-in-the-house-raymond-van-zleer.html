Excerpt :
So leave it to Tom to sum up the situation: A mans home is supposed to be his castle but yours is in the garage and you cant use it cause a vampires sleeping in it.
I grinned back: A vampires not vampire until it has a coffin.
Having lived with my sisters unsuccessful death for so long, I was now more than just comfortable with gallows humor.
I was flaunting it.
At least when adults and parents could not overhear me.
So when Tom suggested: Maybe we should build her one?
I countered: My parents will skin us alive if we do and yours will too!
Then its a go?
You bet!" />

        &lt;h2&gt;Four sizzlingly sexy romances from Mills &amp; Boon&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martinez&#39;s Pregnant Wife&lt;/em&gt; by Rachael Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Lisa Martinez last saw her estranged husband Maximiliano she was walking out on their relationship for good. Her heart and her dignity were in tatters after she had once more given in to the temptation of Max’s seduction, and she knew divorce was her only option.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Merciless Marriage Bargain&lt;/em&gt; by Jane Porter&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raising her sister’s child has left Rachel Bern penniless and desperate. Her orphaned nephew’s family have ignored her attempts at contact, so she has no choice but to bring him to the Marcellos&#39; Venetian door.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Innocent&#39;s One-Night Surrender&lt;/em&gt; by Kate Hewitt&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Desperate to escape a predatory suitor, Laurel Forrester has no one to turn to in Rome but her stepbrother, Cristiano Ferrero. A dangerous chemistry has always burned between them, even if he does believe her to be exactly like her manipulative mother. And, trapped in his luxurious penthouse, Laurel realises how vulnerable she is to his raw magnetism…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Consequence She Cannot Deny&lt;/em&gt; by Bella Frances&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Talented photographer Coral Dahl can’t afford any distractions on her first major photoshoot. But the beauty of her location – the private Greek island of Hydros – is nothing compared to the lethal charisma of its owner, tycoon Raffaele Rossini! A charisma that wary, innocent Coral is powerless to resist…&lt;/p&gt;

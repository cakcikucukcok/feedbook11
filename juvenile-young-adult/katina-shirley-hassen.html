  <title>Katina - Shirley Hassen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tom, a fisherman, lives with his wife Katie in a small thatch-roofed house. Not young they dearly wished to have a child to love. Tom is often sick but still goes out in his boat to net his fish. Toms catches are not many, catching enough fish for him and Katie, with a few left to sell at the markets. It is in the ocean that a mer-baby is rescued by the mermaid Queen, Coral. Queen Coral seeing the mer-babys black-hair is startled but soon forgets her shock when seeing the baby is of the sea.  With her King she claims the mer-baby as their own. King Trebor names the mer-child, Katina. Katina grows into a mischievous mer-maid. Katina disobeys her mothers warnings about going to the top of the ocean and is caught in a fishermans net. Katina lives many years with Tom and Katie when Katie notices Katinas sadness. Although it breaks Tom and Katies hearts, they send Katina back to her people. Katina grows into a beautiful Siren. Katina is happy with her people but misses Tom and Katie. Going to the old crone for advice, Katina is shocked by the old crones words. Cut off your hair and give it to me! Please! No! Old crone! Not my beautiful hair? Give me your hair or no human body for you! Cutting off her hair, Katina places it in the pearly shell the old crone pushes to her. As the old crone turns to leave, Katina wails, How will I reach the shore? Waving a gnarled finger the old crone causes a high wave to speed Katina to the shore. Katina waits near the sea shore for her body to become human. Believing the old crone has lied to her Katina hides herself by day. For two nights Katina wails until she finally sleeps." />

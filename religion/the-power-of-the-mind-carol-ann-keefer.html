  <title>The Power of the Mind - Carol Ann Keefer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written because one day I was going through in my mind and I just hollered out and told the devil to, Go to hell. I had got tired in my mind. The devil was talking about what was going on in a situation that I was going through, and what God was not going to do. He tried to bombard my mind with this and that. I just told the devil, with my God-given authority, to, Go to hell! And that is what destroyed the yoke in my mind. My mind has been free every since. 
Sometimes you have to just get mad at the devil and his lies and just tell the devil to, Go to hell. Because that is his destination. Hell was created for the devil and his angels. In other words, I just told him to go home, in Jesus name, and I meant that." />

  <title>Anjani the Mighty: A Lost Race Novel (Anjani, Book 2) - John Russell Fearn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anjani returns! in this direct sequel to The Gold of Akada, Rita Perrivale, widow of an English explorer, goes back to the coast of West Africa. Having inherited her husband&#39;s fortune, she spares no expense on this new venture to loot the legendary lost city of Akada of its treasures. But Rita had only survived the disastrous first expedition because of the help of Anjani, a white man of immense strength and stature who had been brought up in the jungle by a native tribe. Now Rita hopes to be reunited with Anjani, but she has reckoned without the danger posed by his treacherous twin brother, Tocoto, who is contesting Ajani for the supremacy of the Dark Continent; and of the beautiful Mea, the ruler of Akada&#39;s ancient sister city. Will Anjani survive the myriad dangers of unknown Africa? Another thrilling jungle adventure in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs!" />

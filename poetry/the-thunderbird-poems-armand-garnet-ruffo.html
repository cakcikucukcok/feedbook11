  <title>The Thunderbird Poems - Armand  Garnet Ruffo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Norval Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s revered work has been honoured, copied and recognized throughout the art world and beyond. Less widely known but equally captivating is the artist&amp;#8217;s personal life story, which poet and biographer Armand Garnet Ruffo related in his powerful narrative biography, &lt;I&gt;Norval Morrisseau: Man Changing into Thunderbird&lt;/I&gt; (Douglas &amp;amp; McIntyre, 2014). Ruffo immersed himself in the life and work of the artist, gaining insight into the struggles and sources of inspiration underlying Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s greatest works through research and interviews with the artist himself&amp;#151;a connection further strengthened by their shared Ojibway heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;     &lt;p&gt;His lengthy study of Morrisseau inspired Ruffo to write poems reflecting on both the works of art and the emotional context in which Morrisseau painted them. &lt;I&gt;Thunderbird Poems&lt;/I&gt; complements the highly evocative and poetic biography, delving into Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s creative life through compressed, imagistic language, while untangling the complex and powerful threads of meaning, tradition and emotional power that resonate throughout Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s strong lines and vibrant colours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Significant themes in Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s work are mirrored in &lt;I&gt;Thunderbird Poems&lt;/I&gt;: Ojibway legends, Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s conflicted religious beliefs, political tensions between white and aboriginal Canadians. Significant moments in Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s life are also traced along with the development of his artistic career. Deeply immersed in Morrisseau&amp;#8217;s life story, and possessing thorough knowledge of the Ojibway storytelling traditions which grounded so much of the artist&amp;#8217;s beliefs and creativity, Ruffo provides fresh poetic interpretations of the most renowned and striking works of one of Canada&amp;#8217;s most celebrated painters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

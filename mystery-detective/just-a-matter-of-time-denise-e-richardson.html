  <title>Just a Matter of Time - Denise E. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessie Myers is facing an uphill struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her husband consumed by his duties as the town sheriff and her son away at college, she spends a great deal of time alone in her New England village house. When a debilitating leg injury takes Jessie away from her nursing career, she is determined to do whatever it takes to get back on her feet again, in every sense. Despite the concerns of the people close to her, she commits to a rigorous exercise regimen along the beaches and cliffs of her Maine home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, she makes an unexpected discovery while on a hike. Drawn to a small opening in the sea cliffs, she finds a small wooden box that has survived years in its hiding place. Once opened, its treasures are revealedincluding a pearl necklace, a mans cap, a coin, and a short story, written by a woman named Gwyn Loxton. Her imagination enflamed by the discovery, Jessie now has a new mission: to uncover the purpose of this captivating little treasure chest. When was the box hidden away? And why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessie thinks its a time capsule, but thats only a small part of the mystery. Determined to learn all she can about this memento from a bygone era, her growing obsession inspires growing concerns from her family and friends. Consumed by the past, will Jessie forget about her own future?&lt;/p&gt;" />

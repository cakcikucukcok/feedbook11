  <title>The Abysmal Brute -  Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Abysmal Brute by Jack London.&lt;/b&gt; Sam Stubener, a boxing manager in San Francisco, travels to a remote log cabin in northern California on getting a letter from retired boxer Pat Glendon, who lives there with his son, Pat Glendon Jr, a promising young boxer. Pat Jr fights well; otherwise, he knows little of city life; he hunts and fishes in the forest, he reads poetry and avoids women. Sam brings Pat Jr back to San Francisco. Although Sam and Pat both know he could win a fight with a top boxer, the conventions of boxing require that Pat has to start with a boxer of lower rank. In his first three fights, he knocks out his opponent immediately with one punch. Sam tells Pat to make his fights last longer; since Pat says that he is master of his opponent &amp;quot;at any inch or second of the fight&amp;quot;, they agree on which round the knockout will happen. Pat&amp;#39;s career takes off, winning fights worldwide. The newspapers, who interpret his detachment from the real world as unsociability, call him &amp;quot;The Abysmal Brute.&amp;quot; Sam protects him from the corruption in boxing. Pat is not aware that Sam is using his knowledge of the timing of the knockout in a betting syndicate." />

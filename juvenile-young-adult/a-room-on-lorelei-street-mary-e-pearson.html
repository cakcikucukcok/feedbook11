  <title>A Room on Lorelei Street - Mary E. Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zoe&#39;s arms prickle. She turns, trying to take it all in. The ache inside returns. It is not for her. It is too much. A real room with real floors and walls. A room for sleeping, and reading and dancing and . . . in her imagination she has pictured the room, but she has never pictured herself in it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can seventeen-year-old Zoe make it on her own?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A room is not much. It is not arms holding you. Not a kiss on the forehead. Not a packed lunch or a remembered birthday. Just a room. But for seventeen-year-old Zoe, struggling to shed the suffocating responsibility of her alcoholic mother and the controlling guilt of her grandmother, a rented room on Lorelei Street is a fierce grab for control of her own future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe rents a small room from Opal Keats, an eccentric old lady who has a difficult past of her own, but who chooses to live in the possibility of the future. Zoe tries to find that same possibility in her own future, promising that she will never go crawling back. But with all odds against her, can a seventeen-year-old who only slings hash to make ends meet make it on her own? Zoe struggles with this worry and the guilt of abandoning her mother as she goes to lengths that even she never dreamed she would in order to keep the room on Lorelei Street.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Overcoming the Spirit of Offense - Anita McCall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Overcoming the Spirit of Offense exposes how the spirit of offense has not only infiltrated the body of Christ but how it has damaged the bride and has kept her from fulfilling her destiny and purpose. Because of the invisible wounds that she has suffered, she walks without much power. The book helps the reader to be able to see and recognize how the spirit operates, and it teaches how to come in the opposite spirit called love in order to get free. 
It is fully equipped with scripture for validation and real-life situations and testimonies that help the reader with their own similar situations. There are testimonies that not only inspire the reader but also challenge them. A testimony of a young woman named Julia will leave the reader in awe of the Fathers heart and what He can do when we choose to love instead of being offended. 
This teaching has been used to minister to hurting pastors and prophets, drug addicts and broken women, and when they choose to forgive the offender, they are almost always completely healed, both physically and emotionally. It has been used to teach the unbeliever about the love of God, the price that Jesus paid, and how the enemy pottered them through offense. This is a teaching that bears fruit." />

  <title>Seven Rights for Citizen Slackers: With Notes from the Battles of Good King Boaz - Dennis Boaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seven Rights for Citizen Slackers has two themes. The principle theme centers around the author Dennis Boaz&#39;s discovery and development of a comprehensive body of rights for workers and citizens, at whose core are seven rights. The author explains why this human rights organizational system would transform society if applied to education, business, and government. Interwoven with the first theme are Boaz&#39;s misguided and outrageous attempts to gain publicity for an earlier seven rights manuscript (a 1976 marijuana smoke-in in San Francisco&#39;s Federal Building and asking the Utah Supreme Court for his client&#39;s [Gary Gilmore] execution). The book also contains memoirs of other public controversies that accompanied much of Boaz&#39;s professional career as a lawyer in Saipan and Guahan (Guam); as a teacher/union leader in Ukiah, California. After numerous morphs spanning several years, the final draft of Seven Rights for Citizen Slackers was completed in November, 2014." />

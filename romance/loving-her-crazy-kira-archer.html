      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Iris Clayton is supposed to be on a tropical island, soaking up the sun and a few dozen mojitos. Instead, she&#39;s snowbound in Chicago overnight, holding out hope the morning flight isn&#39;t cancelled. Good thing there&#39;s a hot cowboy to keep her company. And it doesn&#39;t hurt that Mr. Tall, Calm, and Sun-Streaked can make her tremble with one sultry look from under his well-worn hat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Montana rancher Nash Wallace sucks at ice skating, has no clue what a selfie is, and may be a tad averse to breaking and entering, but being with Iris makes him want to bend a few rules. Or, hell, throw them out the window altogether. She&#39;s fun, spontaneously crazy, and can rock a Muppet fur coat like no one&#39;s business. He&#39;s falling hard and fast, but wanting to spend his life with someone after one night is insane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except, nothing has ever felt so right, and neither of them wants the night to end...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Crazy Love series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Driving Her Crazy&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Kissing Her Crazy&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Loving Her Crazy&lt;/p&gt;" />

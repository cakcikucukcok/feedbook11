  <title>Battlesaurus: Rampage at Waterloo - Brian Falkner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if the power to control the most terrifying animals in history fell into the hands of one of the most brilliant and ferocious military leaders of all time?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Battlesaurus &lt;/i&gt;reimagines the 1815 Battle of Waterloo as something other than a crushing defeat for the French emperor Napoléon Bonaparte, when he unleashes a terrible secret weapon--giant carnivorous survivors from pre-history--on his unsuspecting British and Prussian adversaries. In this world, smaller &quot;saurs&quot; are an everyday danger in the forests of Europe, and the Americas are a forbidden zone roamed by the largest and most deadly animals ever to walk the earth. But in his quest for power, Napoléon has found a way to turn these giant dinosaurs into nineteenth-century weapons of mass destruction. Only Willem Verheyen, an outsider living in hiding in the tiny village of Gaillemarde, has the power to ruin the tyrant&#39;s plans. And Napoléon will stop at nothing to find him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;War is coming, and young Willem is no longer safe, for Gaillemarde is just a stone&#39;s throw from the fields of Waterloo--fields which will soon run red with blood. &lt;i&gt;Battlesaurus: Rampage at Waterloo&lt;/i&gt; by Brian Falkner is the first in a thrilling alternate historical fantasy duology, which concludes with the sequel, &lt;i&gt;Battlesaurus: Clash of Empires&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Part historical fiction, part dinosaur fantasy mash-up, this book will appeal to history buffs and dinosaur fanatics alike. The battle scenes between Napoléon&#39;s army and the British are depicted in incredible detail, making readers feel as if they are right in the midst of the fight . . . The first of a promising duology that readers will find thrilling and positively addicting.&quot;&lt;i&gt; --School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This alternative history asks, what if Napoléon won the battle at Waterloo . . . The novel quickly ramps up to suspense, immersing the reader in the swiftly moving plot. Characters are very well drawn, capturing the reader&#39;s sympathy. With an ending wide open for a sequel, complete with a plot-thickening cliff-hanger, one can only hope that Falkner is a swift writer.&quot;&lt;i&gt; --Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

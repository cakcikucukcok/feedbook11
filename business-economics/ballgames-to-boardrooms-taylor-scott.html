  <title>BALLGAMES TO BOARDROOMS - Taylor Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Taylor Scott has brilliantly packaged a way forward for Millennials and leaders of Millennials to not only coexist in Corporate America, but to also transform menial jobs into meaningful work. If you loved playing sports as a kid or even as an adult, but find yourself stuck in a career hamster wheel, this book is for you. Prepare to reignite the child-like faith you had back then, realizing actionable steps toward new realms of happiness and success today.&amp;quot; - Eric Chester - Bestselling Author of On Fire At Work: How Great Companies Ignite Passion in Their People Without Burning Them Out, Award Winning Keynote Speaker, and the Founder of the Center for Work Ethic Development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Problem: Millennials and those leading Millennials as today&amp;#39;s front-line employees, entry-level managers, middle managers, and even some executives, are caught in the proverbial hamster-in-a-wheel that is Corporate America. A lack of inspiration and motivation looms over people who spend their days, trudging through life as real life &amp;#39;Eyeores&amp;#39;. Many are okay with the sea of mediocrity that is their daily routines, but others, in fact, the majority, have a desire for more; for better days and a more enjoyable, meaningful, fulfilling, and a more productive life - at work and at home. Yet, beautiful, smart, intelligent, creative, and really great people are simply stuck, dead in their tracks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Millennial generation gets frustrated, fed up, and all too often they&amp;#39;re quick to shut down communication with peers and leaders. This prevents those very peers and leaders from seeing their full talent, potential, and beauty. Furthermore, and possibly even scarier, today&amp;#39;s leaders of the Millennial generation get fed up with their teams and individuals they lead. They mistake their attitudes and uncomfortable, social awkwardness for disinterest, lack of urgency and focus. So we&amp;#39;re left with a general lack of connection and engagement among teams all throughout Corporate America. Leaders push rather than pull. They manage through fear as opposed to leading with love. They dictate orders, aiming to break people down as opposed to coaching, building them up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Ballgames to Boardrooms: Lessons From Our Coaches We Never Knew We Needed, Taylor Scott resurfaces what many have forgotten from those simple, yet profound lessons we learned playing sports at a younger age. Our Little League, High School, and College coaches taught us lessons, values, winning principles, and dropped pearl after pearl of wisdom we never knew we needed back then. Taylor is bringing them back to the forefront, and inspiring anyone and everyone who wants a change in their day-to-day grind. The lessons we learned playing sports when we were younger can be applied today, in the midst of our busy, frustrating, often demoralizing, and stressful corporate climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

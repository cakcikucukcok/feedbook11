  <title>Led by Grace - Sandra M. Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all yearn for inner peace and happiness, but for most of us, negative thoughts and disturbing events seem to make any meaningful, lasting peace unattainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in eight parts, Led by Grace leads us through a process of forgiveness that brings us to serenity. It begins with Sandra Lowes first meditations in the spring of 2001 and ends with her 925-kilometer pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela in the fall of 2009. In the Beginning is the first book in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra courageously shares her powerful story of growing to know her Self. From her first meditations, she is taken on journeys where she receives lessons and becomes witness to miracles. Sandra deepens our understanding of each meditation with an insightful interpretation and offers a means for bringing each lesson into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we place ourselves in Sandras journal entries, we encounter a vulture pecking away at our legs, are taken to a City of Gold, cross bridges that light up, become naked and experience love, find the keys to our Soul, soar with eagles, paint our Self-portrait, bathe in divine waters, and walk with a monk and Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The Led by Grace collection guides us to our Soulto know It, to be It.&lt;/p&gt;" />

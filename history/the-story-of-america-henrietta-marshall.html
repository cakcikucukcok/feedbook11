  <title>The Story of America - Henrietta Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IN days long long ago there dwelt in Greenland a King named Eric the Red. He was a man mighty in war, and men held him in high honour. Now one day to the court of Eric there came Bjarni the son of Heriulf. This Bjarni was a far traveller. He had sailed many times upon the seas, and when he came home he had ever some fresh tale of marvel and adventure to tell. But this time he had a tale to tell more marvellous than any before. For he told how far away across the sea of Greenland, where no man had sailed before, he had found a new, strange land. But when the people asked news of this unknown land Bjarni could tell them little, for he had not set foot upon those far shores. Therefore the people scorned him. &amp;quot;Truly you have little hardihood,&amp;quot; they said, &amp;quot;else you had gone ashore, and seen for yourself, and had given us good account of this land.&amp;quot; But although Bjarni could tell nought of the new strange land, save that he had seen it, the people thought much about it, and there was great talk about voyages and discoveries, and many longed to sail forth and find again the land which Bjarni the Traveller had seen. But more than any other in that kingdom, Leif the son of Eric the Red, longed to find that land. So Leif went to Eric and said:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh my father, I fain would seek the land which Bjarni the Traveller has seen. Give me gold that I may buy his ship and sail away upon the seas to find it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Then Eric the Red gave his son gold in great plenty. &amp;quot;Go, my son,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;buy the ship of Bjarni the Traveller, and sail to the land of which he tells.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

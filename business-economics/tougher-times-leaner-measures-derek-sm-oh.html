  <title>Tougher Times Leaner Measures - Derek Sm Oh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where do you go to when tough times affect both your business and lifestyle? Is there a quick fix to the issues that youre facing now? This book will unravel the secrets to fixing your problems, be it your business or lifestyle. The basic Lean principles have long been in existence for several decades and have been given pseudo names as derivatives of the original meaning of Lean management. All it does is to declutter your issues and let you see the root cause in a transparent manner so that it stays fixed once it is fixed. The methodology used is clearly explained in various chapters- explained in the simplest form that you can comprehend and absorb the gist of what is the issue, how do I go about fixing it, making sure it stays fixed and expect great turnaround results. Many examples have been described so that you can associate to a few or to at least one and use that as a model or case study. Each chapter can be read as standalone topics as it provides actionable knowledge for a reader that knows nothing of Lean principles. You will be absorbed to read this book over and over again as it comes alive for new situations related to your business or work life. The more you read the principles and associate them to the cases mentioned, the more you will uncover the secrets and the spirit of Lean concepts which were originally described by great Lean Gurus over the decades. You will be amazed when the situations turnaround for the betterespecially needed during tougher times like this and you need Leaner measures to combat them." />

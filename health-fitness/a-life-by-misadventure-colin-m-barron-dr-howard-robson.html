  <title>A Life by Misadventure - Colin M. Barron, Dr. Howard Robson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Colin Barron and Vivien Thompson first met, it was love at first sight. Both were forty-two, had attended Glasgow University, and shared many interests. In 2002, the couple married. Colin had a dream job as a self-employed hypnotherapist while Vivien worked as a learning-support teacher. They had a blissful marriage based on mutual respect and intellectual parity. Then in May 2011, Vivien collapsed at home with a massive stroke caused by a heart tumour that the NHS had failed to diagnose. Though her life was saved by a brilliant cardiac surgeon, Vivien was left with severe disabilities, little speech, and partial blindness. Her husband realized that the tragedy had been caused by inadequate investigation and helped Vivien claim compensation. Just after the case was settled in 2015, Colin himself had a massive heart attack and nearly died three times. Miraculously, he survived. 
A Life by Misadventure is a story of two peoples struggle against impossible odds. It is also a great love story, a tale of a love between two people, which would not die. Instead of dying, the love actually got stronger." />

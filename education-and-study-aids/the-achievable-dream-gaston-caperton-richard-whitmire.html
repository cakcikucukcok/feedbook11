  <title>The Achievable Dream - Gaston Caperton, Richard Whitmire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Achievable Dream: College Board Lessons on Creating Great Schools is an inspiring look at solutions to the challenges facing education in America, from one of the nation&#39;s leading authorities. Based on the personal observations of Gaston Caperton, President of the College Board and former Governor of West Virginia, these stories provide hope for the future and specific lessons of educational success that can be replicated in schools across the country - featuring students, parents, educators, policy-makers and communities that are bucking the trends and demonstrating how America can again be a world leader in education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using 10-15 real-world case studies that highlight common traits of successful schools - including rigorous coursework taught by dedicated and skilled teachers; parental involvement; high standards that engage and challenge students; and support from local communities, colleges, and businesses - Caperton highlights models of success that reinforce one central theme: Improving education in America requires a shared commitment to learning that must become a national priority.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="One will discover at one point that life holds many hardships. We all have these types of encounters, whether being in the physical or mental aspect. It has taken me twenty-two years to fully interpret the meaning of being an adult. When I use this term, I mean it in the sense of my being on my own, my own weight, my own responsibility. But its crazy when I really think about it because that aspect I can relate to, but the full meaning that one would deem as actually being an adult is, to say, foreign to me. I have been incarcerated now for over five and a half years. This all began in 2007, when I made a decision that was clouded by both alcohol and youth. This is not even to say that what I chose to do deserved the taking of almost a third of my life, but I look back now and am able to see. I actually see a lot of things now for what they really are. This is my life, my struggle, and the painting you are witnessing being created, you are now able to look at through this artists eyes." />

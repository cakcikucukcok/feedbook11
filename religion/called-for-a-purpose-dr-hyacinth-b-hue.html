  <title>Called for a Purpose - Dr. Hyacinth B. Hue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My life has been filled with love yet not without trials, tests, temptations and persecution. Through it all, God-Jehovah has never left me nor forsaken me, even when I have forsaken Him.
	He has been a constant in my life and has miraculously saved my family and all those with whom I have been in contact. I sincerely pray that this biography of my life with Jesus Christ will encourage the reader to follow the Call in his or her life.
	There is nothing special about me. My only virtue is Gods love, which has brought me to obedience, increased faith, trust, love and forgiveness.
	I am Gods Go-Go Girl
	Wherever He sends me I go!
	Whatever He says Do I do!
	My love for Him is overwhelming, my worship of Him is everlasting, my praise of Him is insufficient, since I have not the tongues of angels. May He hear my praise from the crevices of my heart and continue to bless my efforts as I labour in the vineyard of life, for souls for His kingdom.
	Jesus, keep me near the cross;
	Where the precious fountain,
	Free to all, a cleansing stream,
	Flows from Calvarys mountain.
	In the cross, in the cross,
	Be my glory ever." />

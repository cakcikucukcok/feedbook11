  <title>Come Matter Here - Hannah Brencher, Jess Connolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From viral TED Talk speaker and founder of The World Needs More Love Letters, Hannah Brencher&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Come Matter Here &lt;/em&gt;is the power read you need to start living like you mean it here and now. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is scary. Adulting is hard. When faced with the challenges of building a life of your own, it&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to stake your hope and happiness in &amp;ldquo;someday.&amp;rdquo; But what if the dotted lines on the map at your feet today mattered just as much as the destination you dream of?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Brencher, TED Talk speaker and founder of The World Needs More Love Letters, thought Atlanta was her destination. Yet even after she arrived, she found herself in the same old chase for the next best thing&amp;hellip;somewhere else.&amp;nbsp;And it left her in a state of anxiety and deep depression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our hyper-connected era has led us to believe life should be a highlight reel&amp;mdash;where what matters most is perfect beauty, instant success, and ready applause. Yet, as Hannah learned, nothing about faith, relationships, or character is instant. So she took up a new mantra: be where your feet are. Give yourself a permission slip to stop chasing the next big thing, and come matter here. Engage the process as much as you trust the God who lovingly leads you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are tired of running away from your life or tired of running ragged toward the next thing you think will make you feel complete, &lt;em&gt;Come Matter Here&lt;/em&gt; will help you do whatever it takes to&amp;nbsp;show up for the life God has for you. Whether you need to make a brave U-turn, take a bold step forward, or finish the next lap with fresh courage, find fuel and inspiration for the journey right here.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Dragon Hunters - Marc Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dragon Hunters&lt;/i&gt;, the sequel to Marc Turner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;When the Heavens Fall &lt;/i&gt;features gritty characters, deadly magic, and meddlesome gods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a year on Dragon Day the fabled Dragon Gate is raised to let a sea dragon pass from the Southern Wastes into the Sabian Sea. There, it will be hunted by the Storm Lords, a fellowship of powerful water-mages who rule an empire called the Storm Isles. Alas, this year someone forgot to tell the dragon which is the hunter and which the hunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emira Imerle Polivar is coming to the end of her tenure as leader of the Storm Lords. She has no intention of standing down graciously. She instructs an order of priests called the Chameleons to infiltrate a citadel housing the mechanism that controls the Dragon Gate to prevent the gate from being lowered after it has been raised on Dragon Day. Imerle hopes the dozens of dragons thus unleashed on the Sabian Sea will eliminate her rivals while she launches an attack on the Storm Lord capital, Olaire, to secure her grip on power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Imerle is not the only one intent on destroying the Storm Lord dynasty. As the Storm Lords assemble in Olaire in answer to a mysterious summons, they become the targets of assassins working for an unknown enemy. When Imerle initiates her coup, that enemy makes use of the chaos created to show its hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Walking with My Eyes Closed - William X. Lincoln</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all have a story to tell; I just decided to write mine in poetry to let people know its possible to overcome our mountains. Im not perfect, but I do have faith. This book is about overcoming not just mountains but even ourselves. 
We always think that we know what we are doing and where were going. We have been fooling ourselves in so many ways. This book is to let people know they can change their situations. Sometimes we must go through it so we can show what faith can do, even if its the size of a mustard seed. 
This book is to let people know that no matter what your past was like, you can still become something special. Your past only determines your future if you let it. This book is about pain from a love one, struggles in life, regrets, victory over the enemy, faith, love, manhood, family, and the value of living. You must have a test in order to have a testimony. 
This book is about becoming a victor and not a victim. Its about how you are at your best when you are tired and have nothing left to give. But you still hold your head high and keep fighting the good fight. 
Somebody told me that its better to see where youre going and that the blind cant lead the blind. I say thats the problem: we depend on man to lead. But we also cant see where were going. We must depend on somebody to guide us through the dark times. It just depends on who you choose to guide you. The blind cant lead the blind, because both are blind men. I want God to guide me this time. Thats why I named the book Walking with My Eyes Closed." />

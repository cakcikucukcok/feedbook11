  <title>The Corpse Wore Tartan - Kaitlyn Dunnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can there be such a thing as too many men in kilts? Normally Liss MacCrimmon, proprietor of Moosetookalook, Maine&#39;s one and only Scottish Emporium, would say no. But that&#39;s before one of them turns out to be murderous.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bagpipes are blaring at Moosetookalook&#39;s finest hotel, reopened just in time to host an annual celebration of Scotland&#39;s most beloved poet. But when the Scottish Heritage Appreciation Society arrives on the scene, they bring more than a hunger for haggis and a passion for plaid. The quarrelsome group harbors their share of long held grudges, and the animosity only grows as the whiskey flows. Then a fierce blizzard hits, trapping everyone--angry Scotsmen, hapless hotel staff, and Liss herself--indoors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It isn&#39;t long before a body is discovered face down in a storage room, covered in tartan--and blood. Now Liss will have to work fast to solve this crime before another body goes as cold as the snowstorm keeping her cooped up with a killer." />

  <title>The Shadow Within - Lynette Tait</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lynda Magro is a senior executive at a multi national food company. During her period of employment she meets the man who would turn out to be the father of her only child. Their relationship would lead to an idyllic period of love and fulfillment. Unexpectedly her life however takes a turn which almost ruins her financially, and leaves her emotionally drained. Not only does she have to fight off cancer, accept, and learn to manage her bipolar disorder, but unwittingly gets drawn into a murder mystery. These circumstances, which initially seem to be devastating, however lead her to a journey where she retreats into the mountains of Africa. She is forced to take stock of her life, find emotional awareness and health, and is set on a spiritual path that would have a lasting effect on her life. A combination of real life experiences on bipolar disorders, by the author, intertwined with a fictional story line, makes for a spellbinding read." />

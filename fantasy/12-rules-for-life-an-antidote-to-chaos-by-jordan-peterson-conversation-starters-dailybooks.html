  <title>12 Rules For Life: An Antidote to Chaos??????? by Jordan Peterson | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;12 Rules For Life: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Antidote to Chaos&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;by Jordan Peterson | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
12 Rules for Life is the latest self-help book from psychologist Jordan Peterson. 12 Rules for Life was inspired by a question Peterson answered on the website Quora: &amp;ldquo;What are the most valuable things everyone needs to know?&amp;rdquo; Peterson answers this question from a unique perspective, mixing tradition with new revelations from scientific research. With his informative and humorous style, Peterson explains why people should always stand upright, why it&amp;#39;s important to pet the cats they meet, and why they should leave children alone when they are skateboarding.&lt;br /&gt;
12 Rules for Life became the #1 Most Read book on Amazon in 2018. It also reached the second spot on the Best Seller list for Amazon in 2018, as well. The New York Times&amp;#39; writer, David Brooks, stated that though Peterson&amp;#39;s words may seem harsh, they are the perfect remedy to the way children, especially young men, are raised in the current world. Kelefa Saneh, writing for The New Yorker, wrote that many of Peterson&amp;#39;s words of advice in 12 Rules for Life will be unobjectionable even by his critics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;

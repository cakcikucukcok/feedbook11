      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a riveting true story about life in a polygamist group that goes against everything the author feels to be true. Finally having the courage to break free, the author makes another choice that leads her on a path of turmoil, despair and upheaval. This choice creates a never-ending roller coaster ride which aids in clarity and a new beginning for a much better and brighter future. Having learned from her past choices, the author now consults her inner being, her highest self, before making any decisions. With complete trust and expectation of all great things, the author has broken free of the chains that bound her to a life of mediocrity, and now lives a life of peace, joy, wisdom and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a clear mind and clear heart, the author steps into her power, letting go of fear and moving toward a knowing that all is well.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Black Freedom, White Resistance, and Red Menace: Civil Rights and Anticommunism in the Jim Crow South - Yasuhiro Katagiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Black Freedom, White Resistance, and Red Menace, Yasuhiro Katagiri offers the first scholarly work to illuminate an important but largely unstudied aspect of U.S. civil rights history -- the collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship between professional anti-Communists in the North and segregationist politicians in the South. &lt;br&gt;In 1954, the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools with the Brown v. Board of Education ruling. Soon after -- while the political demise of U.S. senator Joseph R. McCarthy unfolded -- northern anti-Communists looked to the South as a promising new territory in which they could expand their support base and continue their cause. Southern segregationists embraced the assistance, and the methods, of these Yankee collaborators, and utilized the &quot;northern messiahs&quot; in executing a massive resistance to the Supreme Court&#39;s desegregation decrees and the civil rights movement in general. Southern white leadership framed black southerners&#39; crusades for social justice and human dignity as a foreign scheme directed by nefarious outside agitators, &quot;race-mixers,&quot; and, worse, outright subversives and card-carrying Communists.&lt;br&gt;Based on years of extensive archival research, Black Freedom, White Resistance, and Red Menace explains how a southern version of McCarthyism became part of the opposition to the civil rights movement in the South, an analysis that leads us to a deeper understanding and appreciation for what the freedom movement -- and those who struggled for equality -- fought to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;" />

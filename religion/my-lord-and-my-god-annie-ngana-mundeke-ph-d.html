  <title>My Lord and My God - Annie Ngana-Mundeke Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Lord and my God addresses the challenging issue of Christs Deity. The Lord Jesus Christ came to earth to minister among His people and He was called Emmanuel, God with us. The Angel told Joseph to name the child, his wife Mary was about to have, the name of Jesus which means the Savior Who would save His people from sins: She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins [Matthew 1:21].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the Scriptures, we read that the Lord Jesus is called Emmanuel, which means God with us: All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel (which means God with us). [Matthew 1:22-23].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord Jesus is called Mighty God in the Book of Isaiah:&lt;/br&gt;
For to us a child is born,&lt;/br&gt;
to us a son is given,&lt;/br&gt;
and the government will be on his shoulders.&lt;/br&gt;
And he will be called&lt;/br&gt;
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,&lt;/br&gt;
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace [9:6].&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These names clearly indicate that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, our Creator. Yet, many people question Christs Deity despite the meaning of His names- Emmanuel, God with us; Jesus, the Savior. Many people still doubt the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ despite the Lords Claim about Himself: I and the Father are one [John10:30]&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scriptures teach that there is Only One God.
The disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ worshipped Him and they called Him, Lord.
For example: Thomas fell at the Lords Feet and stated: My LORD and My God.
Simon Peter called Him the Messiah [Matthew 16:15].
During His earthly ministry, the Lord Jesus asked His disciples:
 But what about you? He asked. Who do you say I am? [Matthew 16:15].
The disciples gave various answers which were not correct with the exception of Simon Peter who answered, the Messiah as we read in Scriptures, the inspired Word of God:
Simon Peter answered, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God [Matthew 16:15].&lt;/p&gt;" />

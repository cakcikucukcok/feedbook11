The fiasco begins with a call from Jaine&#39;s high-school nemesis,  uber rich uber witch Patti Devane. It seems Patti will soon be sashaying down the aisle with another former classmate from Hermosa High, and she&#39;d like the exchange of vows to evoke Romeo and Juliet.  .  .except without the &quot;downer&quot; of an ending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even worse than the assignment itself is dealing with Patti as a client.  At least Jaine&#39;s not alone, as nobody can stand the demanding, spoiled, and incredibly rude Bridezilla from Hell. Patti&#39;s managed to rack up an amazingly long list of enemies in a short time, not the least of whom include her prospective mother-in-law, the soon-to-be ex-wife of Patti&#39;s stolen soon-to-be groom, and just about everyone involved in the wedding preparations. So it isn&#39;t a complete surprise when the erstwhile Juliet plunges to her death during her balcony scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The loosened bolts that brought down the bride were clearly an act of sabotage--what&#39;s not so obvious is whom, among Patti&#39;s numerous haters, committed this murder most foul.

Jaine&#39;s determined to learn the truth--if only to end the hideous walk down memory lane kicked off by her association with Patti. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between fending off advances from the nerd of her high school nightmares and figuring out ways to stop Prozac the cat from corrupting the victim&#39;s pet Poodle, Jaine&#39;s involvement in this case keeps veering between comedy and tragedy. That is, until another body is discovered--and the killer starts laying plot for a final act--starring Jaine.  .  ." />

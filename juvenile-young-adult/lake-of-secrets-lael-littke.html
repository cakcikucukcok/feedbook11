      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can Carlene really be remembering things from a past life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strange, fragmented memories have been haunting Carlene since she and her mother came to Lake Isadora. The vivid recollections don&#39;t seem to relate to anything in Carlene&#39;s own past. Until now, she hadn&#39;t even seen the place where Keith, the brother she never knew, disappeared during a storm fifteen years ago. Some think he drowned, but his mother thinks he was kidnapped and is still alive somewhere. She is sure the little boy&#39;s clothes that have just been found near the lake belonged to her son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlene knows that her bizarre memories have something to do with Keith. They might even help her discover the truth about what happened the day he disappeared. But she can&#39;t possibly be remembering things that happened before she was born-unless the memories are from a past life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Houses Divided - Marilynn Knott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-first-century Christians face a host of complex, divisive issues that threaten the unity of the church. In &lt;i&gt;Houses Divided&lt;/i&gt;, author Marilynn Knott challenges the members of churches in the United States to put aside their differences and start conversations that can bring them together as the active and functioning Body of Christ in the world today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knott connects the struggles facing modern society on social issues with those faced by Christians trying to apply biblical values to modern life. In &lt;i&gt;Houses Divided&lt;/i&gt;, she first sketches the basic tenets of Christianity and responds to the tenets as they relate to society. She then provides a discussion of sin and looks at greed in our culturehow it impacts society, and how individuals and the body of Christ are called to turn away from its enticements. She discusses the place and role of government within the United States. Finally, she suggests a continuum of caring that brings entities together to address providing for the common good and explores some of the sticky-wicket issuesabortion, guns, immigration, and homosexualitythat currently divide Christians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing personal experiences to help illustrate her vision of a more caring world, Knott makes a clear argument for the importance of applying the broad principles of Jesuss teachings to helping the less fortunate. &lt;/p&gt;" />

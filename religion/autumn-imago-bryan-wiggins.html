  <title>Autumn Imago - Bryan Wiggins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this poignant spiritual novel that echoes the emotional resonance of &lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/em&gt;, an unexpected reunion at a remote lakeside camp in the Maine woods offers the possibility of reconciliation and healing for a man and his fractured family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Paul Strand has been estranged from his family. But when his mother&#39;s escalating Alzheimer&#39;s disease creates a crisis that calls him home, he&#39;s pressured into hosting a reunion he&#39;s avoided for decades in the one place he thought his family would never return to: the rural state park in Maine where his little sister drowned years before on a family vacation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of ten days of guiding his family over difficult terrain, Paul finds himself torn between his desire for isolation and the need to reconnect with the only people who can make him whole. But after a lifetime of separation, is the painful chasm between them&amp;#8212;and within Paul&#39;s own soul&amp;#8212;too deep to overcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryan Wiggins&#39;s beautifully rendered novel illuminates the mysterious power of the wilderness and the resiliency of the human spirit to heal in the wake of devastating trauma.&lt;/p&gt;" />

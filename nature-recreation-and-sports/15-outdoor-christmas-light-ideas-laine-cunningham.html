Some yards are so crowded with angels and snowmen that there&amp;rsquo;s no room for Santa Claus!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use thousands of miniature holiday lights to become a superstar in your neighborhood. People who live in an apartment or condo don&amp;rsquo;t even have to have a yard. They can use these ideas for a fantastic light display on a balcony or in a window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the fifteen easy and simple decorative light ideas in this book, anyone can arrange their outdoor Christmas display in an utterly unique way. Just a little creativity and a handful of inexpensive, affordable light strands will &amp;ldquo;paint&amp;rdquo; your lawn, house and mailbox with lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every idea in this book can be made with incandescent lights or LED lights. Most of the ideas take only minutes to create. Each project is very inexpensive.

With just a few craft items, create a string of penguins that look as cute in the daytime as they do at night!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional entries teach you how to make giant outdoor globes for one dollar, a forest of Christmas trees for less than $5 each, two kinds of cozy hearths, a Southern-style bottle tree Christmas tree, and giant candy canes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this book, you will be able to decorate your mailbox like a lighted holly tree. Add a glacial waterfall for trellis figures that flap, fly, and swim. A toy workshop scene, a manger scene, a letter to Santa station, and a lighthouse candle round out the variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the whole thing off with a unique lighted border that will capture attention. Every idea in this book is easy enough to make with your kids. They are also creative enough to be fun for the grandparents!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;15 Outdoor Christmas Light Ideas&lt;/em&gt; will create true joy for you, your family, and your neighbors.

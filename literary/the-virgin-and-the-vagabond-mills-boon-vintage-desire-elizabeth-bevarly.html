          &lt;strong&gt;BLAME IT ON BOB AFTER YEARS OF WAITING FOR MR. RIGHT…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hometown girl Kirby Connaught was saving herself - if not for marriage, then at least for the perfect man. Someone who was husband and father material. Someone who was clearly… not the arrogant and sexy, no-strings-attached playboy at her door. So why was she having such a hard time resisting him?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;WAS IT OKAY TO SAMPLE A LITTLE OF MR. WRONG? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Globe-trotting bachelor James Nash was the &quot;most desirable man in America,&quot; yet suddenly a small corner of it was looking mighty appealing to him. He knew that Kirby really wanted happily-ever-after with a local boy - but what was the harm in getting her to expand her territory a little?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BLAME IT ON BOB:&lt;em&gt; The comet passes through only once every fifteen years… but it leaves behind a lifetime of love!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Civil War Comes Home - Jake McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Highly Recommended by Dr. J. Hindman, School of Education, College of William &amp; Mary
&lt;p&gt;What was it like living in a small sleepy Southern town when the war suddenly arrived on the doorstep 150 years ago? Th ese are the stories of residents from various walks of life, and the struggles they face as the Unions Peninsula Campaign deploys forces to Fort Monroe, engages just east of Williamsburg, then continues, On to Richmond! as their battle cry went. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-William &amp; Mary students, like Th omas Barlow, face life-changing decisions: to return home, or enlist with his classmates? Some of them would become heroes, but many more casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Slaves, like W.B. Nelson, must decide as well: should he remain with his master or runaway? While some remain, many become contrabands, and later freedmen, and colored troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Politicians, like Benjamin Butler of Boston, are given the rank of Major General despite the lack of any military experience, while General George B. McClellan, who despised President Lincoln and Washington politics, later runs for national offi ce. Neither transformation is particularly successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Williamsburg residents, like shopkeeper William W. Vest and family must decide between fl eeing as refugees, or staying, like William Peachy, lawyer, to endure Federal occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Williamsburgs women, like Letitia Tyler Semple, lead efforts to improve soldier medical care, opening their homes to thousands of wounded. Others, like Mary Payne, persevere to be at her husbands bedside, while Miss Margaret Durfey falls in love with her patient.&lt;/p&gt;" />

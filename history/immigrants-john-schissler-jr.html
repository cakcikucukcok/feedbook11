  <title>Immigrants - John Schissler Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="War crimes do not end with the war. Revisit this riveting memoir as told by a Croatian immigrant, whose family became unwitting actors in the cruel theater of a postwar Europe, and how they survived to tell their story.
In this compelling frame story, the author intertwines his return to his ancestral home with his past in Croatia. All the wonderful images and emotions, which he experienced in 2015, stand in stark contrast to those years from 1943 to 1950 when he and his family embarked on a protracted journey fraught with danger, disease, and death in a war-torn Europe.
The authors meaningful pilgrimage in 2015 not only reveals all the beauty and charm of Croatia but also reminds us of the need to take a renewed look at the issue of immigration and family. After his return voyage, the author brings home the affirmation and reminder that we are all immigrantsthat melting pot that makes us a stronger America." />

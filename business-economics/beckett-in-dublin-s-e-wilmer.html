  <title>Beckett in Dublin - S.E. Wilmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ireland, and in particular Dublin, was Samuel Beckett&#39;s cradle, a place, in Eoin O&#39;Brien&#39;s words, he revisited &#39;with the same intensity that Proust went back to Combray&#39;. It was fitting, then, shortly after Beckett&#39;s death, that his birthplace - through the good offices of the Gate Theatre, Trinity College and Radio Telefã­s ÃÂ‰ireann - should have decided to honour the 1969 Nobel prizewinner by staging all of his dramatic productions over three weeks during October 1991 and hosting a series of visual displays, lectures, seminars and discussions by local and international scholars, friends and colleagues, of which Beckett in Dublin is the fruit. Part One, &#39;A Man of Theatre&#39;, concerns Beckett&#39;s stagecraft, with learned essays by his English editor James Knowlson and American collaborator S.E. Gontarski, and a lively reminiscence by French actor Jean Martin, who played Lucky in the original production of En attendant Godot in 1953. Part Two, &#39;Themes and Structures&#39;, ranges from a feminine focus in Beckett examined by the American academic Linda Ben-Zvi, through pieces by Katherine Worth, Declan Kiberd and Rosemary Pountney, to the post-modernist reckonings of reader in English at the University of London, Stephen Connor. Part Three, &#39;At Heart a Dubliner&#39;, reaffirms the writer&#39;s human dimensions with recollections by his publisher John Calder and friend Georges Belmont, concluding with appreciations of Beckett as a poet and Irishman by Brendan Kennelly and James Mays. One of the book&#39;s most striking features is a sequence of Rembrandtesque photographs by Tom Lawlor of each of Beckett&#39;s plays, taken at the Gate Theatre performances. They form a visual tribute to this powerful dramatist and writer." />

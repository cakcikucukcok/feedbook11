          &lt;strong&gt;It started with a kiss…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bel was planning to marry Roderick, but then Andrew Storm, a complete stranger, turned her life upside down. Andrew skillfully and masterfully seduced Bel in ways she&#39;d only imagined in her dreams. He was a first-class male with a talent for seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Slowly Bel found herself drawn into his web until there was no other way out: she had to leave Roderick and marry Andrew. But little did Bel know that Andrew had a secret agenda of his own - and his plans included Bel!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Rush Limbaugh, “I Hope He Fails,” Bailed out America. - Ndyfreke Nenty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RUSH LIMBAUGH, I HOPE HE FAILS, BAILED OUT AMERICA, is Rushs industry. Rush Limbaughs fingerprints are all over the book. The bulk of the book contains brilliant perspectives from Rush Limbaugh on the twenty-one months of the Obama presidency, the destructive liberalism ideology and the bitter truth about racism and many more issues that we faced.
The book also covers the 2008 general election, the scheduled 2010 midterm elections and the effectiveness of the four words I hope he fails.
About Barack Obama, Rush said Radicalism comes dressed in many ways. This time its dressed up as Barack Obama.
About the future of America, Rush said And with nothing to stop him {Obama}, theres nothing to stop him. And as theres nothing to stop him hes going to continue to try to get away with as much as he can, and at some point people are gonna go, Wait a minute, I didnt think I was going to have to go to DMV to withdraw money from my bank.
Rush Limbaughs comment I hope he fails turned water into wine. It significantly transformed the Republican Party from a stale, near extinct Party that lost the presidency and both houses of Congress to a Party brimming with confidence and with concrete signs of winning back both houses of Congress from the Democratic Party within 24 months of electing a Democrat as the first African American United States president.
The impact of Rushs words also rendered some of Obamas radical agendas dead in the water. It remains to be seen if Obama and the Democratic Party will reverse the wine back to water.
Rush has harsh messages for those Republican lawmakers who would rather compromise their core values than be subjected to withering and vile criticism by their opponent. After twenty-one months of a torrid reign as president, are Obamas salad days as president over? Has Obama finally turned the corner? It all remains to be seen. Rush Limbaughs criticism of President Obama is not for political expedient. Its for the survival of this great country. We will find out why, after 20 years, Rush continues to be Americas last man standing." />

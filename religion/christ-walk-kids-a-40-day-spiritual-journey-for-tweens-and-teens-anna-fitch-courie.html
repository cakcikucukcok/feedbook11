  <title>Christ Walk Kids: A 40-Day Spiritual Journey for Tweens and Teens - Anna Fitch Courie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Builds on success of Christ Walk (for adults) -- an ecumenical audience • Promotes healthy, Christian exercise for tweens and teens • Provides a pathway for youth to healthy, biblically based practices   Developed as a companion to Christ Walk: A 40-Day Spiritual Fitness Program, new Christ Walk Kids is an exciting 40-day journey for youth (ages 11 and up) to explore mind, body, and spiritual health while setting physical goals by committing to walk different routes based on routes in the Bible. Each chapter explores a topic that everyone thinks about, but not everyone knows how to address.    Anna Courie opens up a discussion with youth about health topics they think and talk about among themselves, but puts the dialogue in the perspective of spiritual development. Key to the success of this outline is that each day there are topics for youth and parents and/or youth leaders to use as they explore health in a safe environment. Youth are encouraged to participate fully in the Christ Walk program by physical challenges (walking, running, or biking &quot;biblical&quot; routes); mental challenges (deep discussion and thoughtfulness of youth health risks); and spiritual challenges (biblical references and spiritually grounded self-development). Youth and parents are urged to participate together in the Christ Walk program so that the church can address the health of the entire family holistically: mind, body, and spirit." />

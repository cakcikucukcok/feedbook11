  <title>The Holy Qur&#39;an - Jonathan K. Crockett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV class=Section1&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;There are many books that attempt to show the similarities between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs. While this book does accomplish that, it takes a step further, using the verses of the Quran to show more than just similarity of beliefs. It shows that Muslims believe in Jesus and, according to their scriptures, believe in following Christ. It shows that they believe the Christian churches of the time were following apostate beliefs. The people of Islam were awaiting the restoration of all Truths as taught by all prophets including Jesus Christ. There are many who do not realize the sheer number of references to Christ that exist in the Quran. Nor do many realize the teachings about the council in heaven, the creation, the occurrences in the Garden of Eden, the need for prophets, the miraculous conception of Jesus, Jesus restoration of the true religion, miracles performed by him, his resurrection and ascension, the apostasy; the prophecies of other chosen people and scriptures, another restoration and more prophets yet to come as taught in the verses of the Quran. This work should be, if not intriguing, at least enlightening for every reader no matter what their religious background or beliefs. Some alternate spellings for Quran are koran and quran. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

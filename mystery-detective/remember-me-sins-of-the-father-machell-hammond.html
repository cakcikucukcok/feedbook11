  <title>Remember Me: Sins of the Father - Machell Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After leaving New Orleans following a hurricane, Alisa Washington finds herself all alone as she takes refuge in Atlanta. Seeing a help wanted sign in the window of a small boutique, Lisa quickly starts a job there with Ida Stanford. But once she finishes her studies in physiology and gets a job at the local hospital, Lisa&amp;rsquo;s life changes forever. Ida becomes ill and is admitted into the hospital, and Lisa finds herself being stalked by a dark figure. &amp;nbsp;Devin Jones, who decides it is time for him to get his life together, goes on a journey to meet the beautiful woman he bumped into at the mall. But on dark roads, Devin Jones and Christ Weber&amp;rsquo;s lives collide, leaving one dead and the other in the hospital with amnesia. &amp;nbsp;After waking up in the hospital, John Doe finds beautiful Lisa standing over his bedside, and there is an immediate attraction between the two. But one night while he watches her sleep, John Doe notices a tall, dark, evil presence watching Lisa. Suddenly, he has flashes of memory of the dark presence that tried to kill him on the dark road. &amp;nbsp;After discovering she is pregnant, and the father of her unborn child does not remember her, Lisa finds herself alone. The dark figure wants to kill her and take her unborn child. Can Lisa survive?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>One Hand on the Podium - John E. Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FBI AGENTS TOM MERRITT AND STEVE FRANKANO arent accomplices to murder, but theyre beginning to feel that way. As they watch a young womans mangled body being removed from a landfill, they know who committed the crime. They also know hes an evil man of powera politician who stays beneath the law enforcement radar. And yet they cant arrest and convict him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the murderer is also guilty of treason,
the US government waits in hopes that the
treason is what will ultimately bring down the
man in question, retired US Air Force Colonel
Simon Moss. Moss is a charismatic official who
is climbing the political ladder. On the side, hes
also selling secrets to the Syrian government. If
Merritt and Frankano bring him in for murder,
how will they catch Mosss Syrian connection? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its not an easy war being waged as espionage takes precedence over cold-blooded killing. 
The FBI watches and waits as more innocent lives are lost, but the law cant wait forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />

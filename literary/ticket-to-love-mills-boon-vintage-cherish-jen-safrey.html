          &lt;strong&gt;A DOLLAR AND A DREAM…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Acey Corelli was as saucy and unforgettable as the pizza she dished out in her Long Island hometown. So when she found out that the shy Southern man down the block was the winning ticket holder in the $35 million lottery, what else could she do but become his friend and coax him to claim the prize? What Acey didn&#39;t know was how he&#39;d win her &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt;….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Harry Wells had more secrets than Acey suspected…including a troubling past that he wanted left back in Texas. But despite their differences, Harry couldn&#39;t get the feisty New Yorker out of his mind. &lt;em&gt;Had&lt;/em&gt; he hit the jackpot–in more ways than one?&lt;/p&gt;

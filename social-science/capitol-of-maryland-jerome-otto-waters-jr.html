Prison is the only university guaranteed program for children in America. Our country has 2.3 million prisoners, which is the worlds largest inmate population. We have more prisoners than China, a nation that has four times as many people as the United States. Those who are incarcerated are disproportionately people of color who are products of a society that has neglected and marginalized them.
More than 2,300 Maryland inmates were serving a life sentence in 2008. Nearly 77% of those inmates are African Americans, making Maryland the state with the largest share of black prisoners serving life sentences. Among the 269 prisoners in Maryland sentenced to life for crimes committed when they were juveniles, 226 are black. The only thing Mary about this land was bloody Mary, but dont get it confused with the alcoholic beverage, Maryland-Murdaland. This is my story, welcome to THE CAPITAL OF MARYLAND." />

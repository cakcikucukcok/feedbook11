      <meta name="description" content="Do you second-guess your appeal? Are you in a relationship that is no longer working and havent found the strength to leave? Are you consumed with self-doubt?

In The Pretty Thoughts of a Hot Chick, Rivers offers a collection of inspirational quotes, mini essays and affirmations to help you think optimistically and turn the negative thoughts in your life into positives. The reflections include: 
If I want to be treasured, I must first believe in my worth and treasure myself. 
I will not think negatively! I do not believe in my last thought. I am thinking something pretty right now. 
Life is a banquet and most of us are starving to death. I choose to eat heartily. 
If I dont think for myself, then someone else will do the thinking for me.

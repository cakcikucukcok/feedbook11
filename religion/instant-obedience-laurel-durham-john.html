  <title>Instant Obedience - Laurel Durham-John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Obedience to what the Lord has asked of us gives us an opportunity to please our Heavenly Father. Doing what is right with the aid of the Holy Spirit gives to us inner peace and contentment. It is definitely a joy when one knows that he or she has listened to the Heavenly Father and has obeyed His call. 
This book gives you an insight to what it is like to obey and then be rewarded for that obedience. Obeying instantly saved my life. I wont imagine what could have happened had I not obeyed. You can find stories of deep faith and some that came about with faith as small as a mustard seed. 
I challenge you to be obedient to the Lord when He speaks to you. Obedience to His voice gives life." />

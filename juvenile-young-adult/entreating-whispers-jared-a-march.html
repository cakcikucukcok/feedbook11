  <title>Entreating Whispers - Jared A. March</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gifted with a rare, ultra sensitive hearing capability caused by a virus at age eight, Tia Fleisher learns about the power of her extraordinary hearing and about the problems associated with being different.&lt;P&gt;
Fearing for her safety, she is placed under the protection of the FBI and enters a highly secretive youth program for gifted children where she will be nurtured as a future covert operative.&lt;P&gt;
After graduating as valedictorian and with an approved FBI guardian, she enters the &quot;unofficial&quot; FBI apprentice program in Washington D.C. where she again excels. While at the Bureau, working on sophisticated computer program design and a &quot;psychic&quot; surveillance procedure, she earns the respect and admiration of the Assistant Director of the FBI who later recruits her into the CIA. But, because of compromises to her personal value structure, she loses heart and passion for the undercover life-style and enters the private sector at the end of her mandatory three-year commitment to federal service.&lt;P&gt;
In &lt;I&gt;Entreating Whispers&lt;/I&gt;, we see Tia hold true to her morals, her ideals, and her empathetic nature as she maneuvers her way through a world of adult deception and ruthlessness that has the full acceptance of the unwitting American public." />

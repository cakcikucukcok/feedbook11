  <title>8 Weeks to Bliss - Mary Catherine Casto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on a PROVEN program with LIFE CHANGING results. The single biggest difference between your seminars and other programs isyou find the root of the situation and get the person to start healing themselves. Marian Kloter
8 Weeks to BLISS allows anyone to be in control of their mind. Miraculously, even cravings go away. Anonymous. I can tell whos using the technique that controls negative thoughts they are more positive and their self-esteem improves. Additionally, finances, motivation, and appearances improve within 2-6 weeks. Sounds impossible, but with the technique in Lesson 3 negative thoughts DISAPPEAR.  Finally, talkative people listen. Chaotic people become prompt. Focusing on the mind definitely creates success. Saying the technique to combat negative thoughts is the key. Does this mean we actually have a wellness program where the results last? Exactly, weight is maintained. The book targets overeaters, 60% of the population. Yet anorexics and bulimics are discussed also. I contacted our toughest cases three years later and guess what? They all were still using the simple technique and were enjoying the desired results. Her program made me a lot healthier and I recommend it wholeheartedly. Ron V. 
THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ, to allow you to become the person you want to be." />

~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My parents think I&amp;#39;m strange, you know,&amp;rdquo; he told Lily. They were sitting companionably on the bank of the creek, tossing pebbles into the clear water, their feet dangling in the stream. The sweet smell of plum blossoms floated by them in the warm breeze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I wish you had let Maggie see you when I brought her here,&amp;rdquo; he continued, somewhat peevishly. &amp;ldquo;Or Mama. Then they would know you were real, and not an imaginary friend. Mama told me not to talk about you where anyone else could hear me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lilaea ignored the subject, just as she did any she did not wish to discuss. &amp;ldquo;The turtles are out,&amp;rdquo; she said with a smile, pointing at three lumpy objects basking in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlie followed her as she turned, and the breeze brought the scent of her hair to his nose. He shifted uncomfortably. Over the past year he had been growing more and more aware of Lily&amp;#39;s physical presence during their time together. In fact, it was now a rare day when he did not have to duck into the barn after spending time with her and bring himself to shuddering release.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today Lily was wearing a dress which seemed to incorporate all the flowers of spring. Thousands of delicate petals were somehow woven together into a multi-hued pastel garment which clung to her body like a second skin. From his vantage point beside her, he could peek down the open neckline and see the swells of her breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She turned back towards him, her eyes wicked, and he flushed crimson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What were you looking at, naughty little boy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m not little anymore,&amp;rdquo; he said, stung by her tone. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m taller than you are now.&amp;rdquo; Indeed, that had been a day to savor last autumn, when he finally passed her in height.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lily flipped a hand dismissively. &amp;ldquo;All little boys are the same. They all want what they can&amp;#39;t have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hardly daring to breathe, Charlie reached out his hand and took hers, their fingers entwining. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m not like other boys,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She turned her head and looked deep into his eyes. He sank into them, feeling as if he were drowning. She cupped his cheeks in her tan hands, the cool skin a balm on his hot face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, you&amp;#39;re not.&amp;quot; Soft as a whisper, her lips brushed his cheek, making him burn." />

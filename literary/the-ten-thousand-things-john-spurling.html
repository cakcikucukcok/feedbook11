  <title>The Ten Thousand Things - John Spurling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In the turbulent final years of the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Meng is a   low-level bureaucrat, employed by the government of Mongol conquerors   established by the Kublai Khan. Though he wonders about his own complicity wit this regime--the Mongols,   after all, are invaders--he prefers not to dwell on his official duties,   choosing instead to live the life of the mind.  Wang is an extraordinarily gifted artist. His paintings are at once   delicate and confident; in them, one can see the wind blowing through   the trees, the water rushing through rocky valleys, the infinite expanse   of China&#39;s natural beauty.  But this is not a time for sitting still, and as The Ten Thousand Things   unfolds, we follow Wang as he travels through an empire in turmoil. In   his wanderings, he encounters, among many memorable characters, other   master painters of the period, including the austere eccentric Ni Zan, a   fierce female warrior known as the White Tigress who will recruit him   as a military strategist, and an ugly young Buddhist monk who rises from   beggary to extraordinary heights.  The Ten Thousand Things is rich with exquisite observations,   and John Spurling endows every description--every detail--with the   precision and depth that the real-life Wang Meng brought to his   painting. But it is also a novel of fated meetings, grand battles, and   riveting drama, and in its seamless fusion of the epic and the intimate,   it achieves a truly singular beauty. A novel that deserves to be   compared to the classic Chinese novels that inspired it, The Ten   Thousand Things is nothing short of a literary event.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

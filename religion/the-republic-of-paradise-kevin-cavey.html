  <title>The Republic of Paradise - Kevin Cavey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a vision about ultimate Femininity and the part it plays in the creation of the Universe. This very simple prophecy is derived from the evidence that lies before us. For example it traces a sacred link beginning when teams of Physicists journey into space, and through the Forces of Nature come face to face with the Blessed Trinity. On the journey we meet Larry and Everina who is a cadet on board the good ship Callisto as it hurdles outwards into the unknown. We meet Hiroshi and Jill, who marry while inParadiseand hoping the bond will hold when they return to earth. Listen in bewilderment to Spirinda (The Holy Spirit) as she relates her great fete - the production of her loving Universe to be cherished and saved at all cost, despite the threats from a cruel Ibis. This story is a bold proposal representing the most likely order of events that may lie ahead, while also attempting to answer many questions, yet giving great hope to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;" />

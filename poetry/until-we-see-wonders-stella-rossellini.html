  <title>…Until We See Wonders - Stella Rossellini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of work which has been compiled into a single book, consisting of a variety of intense emotions based on personal memories; sorrow, happiness and despair. However, not all poetry is personal; revealing different perceptions of lifes journeys. Some writing allows you to peek through the window of surrealism, wrapping around you whilst reading. Hope and despair in one cup, drink it down and let it run through your throat and down into your body with a bit of comedy as an appetiser. Let the exotic taste of life digest into your system, where your mind flows into a new sanctuary. Allow yourself to consume the juice that runs through all dimensions of life. 
Infinity, that is time.  
This book is not only a collection of writing, but it also contains illustrations to supplement the poetry and carry you away, creating a whole new world with a colourful impact." />

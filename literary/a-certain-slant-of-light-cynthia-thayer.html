  <title>A Certain Slant of Light - Cynthia Thayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Cynthia Thayer&#39;s debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Strong for Potatoes&lt;/i&gt;, was the tender relationship between a girl and her grandfather, constantly evolving as their lives grew and changed.  Now, in Thayer&#39;s second novel, she tackles another kind of relationship, one between strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter lost his wife and children in a fire years ago, yet the wounds are still as fresh as if it happened yesterday.  He&#39;s turned into something of a hermit in a cabin on the coast of Maine, shearing sheep and gardening to live, an old Passamaquoddy woman his only friend.  Elaine is eight months pregnant and on the run from her husband, a hard man more interested in control than love.  Fear is simply a part of her life, fear for herself and her unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Elaine turns up outside Peter&#39;s cabin during one of Maine&#39;s worst winter storms in years, Peter can&#39;t turn her away into the ice.  Holed up together in his one-room home, the two troubled, lonely adults clash, then slowly discover that friendship, support, and healing can come in the most unlikely places.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Legacy of Erich Zann and Other Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos - Brian Stableford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the longest of the four Cthulhu Mythos stories in this collection, &quot;The Legacy of Erich Zann,&quot; the violin and the music that the ill-fated musician left behind become the target, some fifteen years later, for a mysterious searcher who will stop at nothing--including murder--to obtain them. Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s great detective, Auguste Dupin, who&#39;s endangered because of his connection to Zann, must not only figure out who--but why.   &lt;P&gt;In the original novella, &quot;The Seeds from the Mountains of Madness,&quot; it turns out that the famous Captain Oates, whose body was never found after he left Scott&#39;s tent in the Antarctic, did not die after all--or, if he did, still retained his ability to function in the world. Sent back to England with a mission to fulfill, Oates seeks the help of an old school friend, a veteran of the Great War--who must also play detective, endeavoring to determine who or what has sent Oates back--and, of course, why!   &lt;P&gt;Also included are two short stories, &quot;The Holocaust of Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;The Truth About Pickman.&quot;   &lt;P&gt;Riveting horror--gripping mystery--from a master storyteller." />

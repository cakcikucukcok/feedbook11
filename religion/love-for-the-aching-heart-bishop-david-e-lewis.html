  <title>Love for the Aching Heart - Bishop David E. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to give an overview of the power of the love of God to those who are aching and craving for it and how we can help them reach their full potential in Christ. The church of the Living God has a tremendous responsibility to share his love to this dying world. Many people think that God doesnt love them, so they express the idea that people think that they are not important. They believed God thinks of them in the same way. Therefore, this book is written to let them know that God loves them regardless of their status in life. 
In order for us to operate in the spirit of love, the Holy Spirit must purify our hearts and motivate us to assist and respond to the situation of others. However, you must have a desire to love for love is a choice you must make. If you love, you must demonstrate the spirit of forgiveness. The first stage of forgiveness is the decision not to try to inflict a reciprocal amount of pain on anyone who caused you hurt. When I forgive you, I give up the right to hurt you back. When you hold fast to run unforgiving spirit toward another person, you tend to believe only bad things about them. You might think of them only in terms of the hurt they caused you, and you want to forget their humanity. 
This book sets forth the principle of love for those who are aching for it and teaches us to forgive as Christ also forgave us. You must be wholly submissive to the leading of the Holy Spirit." />

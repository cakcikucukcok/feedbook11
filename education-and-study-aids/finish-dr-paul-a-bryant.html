  <title>Finish! - Dr. Paul A. Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do so many parents spend more time planning their family vacations than preparing their kids for life after high school? FINALLY, there&#39;s a &quot;how to succeed in college&quot; book that will not only help parents guide their student but also will be something students will want to read.  Even if you&#39;re not a top performing student, this book will help guide you toward college graduation and personal success by offering alternative ways of looking at and dealing with questions most asked by students today including:
	What college should I attend?
	What major is best for me?
	How do I get the most out of my college experience?
	How do I stay focused, graduate on time, and succeed? 
This book is a &quot;we need to read this together&quot; moment for parents and students thats quickly becoming recommended reading for every college student.  Dr. Bryant draws upon over twenty years of experience as a university vice president and professional consultant (http://www.manageenrollment.com) to provide no-nonsense, clear advice on how to pick the right university and program of study -- and then how not only to survive college, but to succeed and thrive! As a parent, you&#39;ve done so much for your student. Now, as they approach adulthood and college, you have one final step: set them up for success in college." />

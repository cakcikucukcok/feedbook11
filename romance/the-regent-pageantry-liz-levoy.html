&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A Historical Regency Romance Novel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a duchy of over seventeen noble families with lords and ladies of different kinds, Henry Forehouse is searching for a wife to be his duchess when he eventually becomes the duke of Forington, even though he is secretly in love with Eunice Manderly, a noble lady. Eunice Manderly, however, is in love with a man, Kent Fillbutton, who is already betrothed to another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happens when the truth comes out and the wife comes for her husband? What happens when it is time to rule and our duke is without a duchess? Will he pick up one of the numerous ladies at his disposal or will he wait patiently for the one he loves? In his wait, what happens when the noble lords of Forington begin to grumble?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Regent Pageantry is a story of love, passion, betrayal and nobility. Suspenseful! Heart gripping! You can&amp;#39;t stop until you are done!&lt;br /&gt;

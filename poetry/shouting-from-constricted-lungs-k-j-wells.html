  <title>Shouting from Constricted Lungs - K. J. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had a chance to see the author K.J. Wells at a reading in Philadelphia for the Vol. 20 launch of Philadelphia Poets. She read Trophy Hunter, Kites, and Sacrifice. Her energy was awesome! She does a beautiful job in Kites paralleling letting go of grief and learning how to fly.
Sacrifice was reminiscent of Love Jones and Neo-Soul and Brown Sugar. It gives you that finger snapping, Jill Scott scandalous actually...but delicious! I had to fan myself! It&#39;s like a neo soul poetic version of 50 Shades. The poem is hot!
Trophy Hunter elicits images of the predatory nature of animals/abusers, juxtaposed with a man seeking to make a trophy of his victims. It&#39;s very intense!
I don&#39;t normally go for poetry, though I appreciate it&#39;s art. I prefer longer stories that unfold page by page and chapter by chapter. I think I&#39;ll add more to my repertoire after this reading. KJ Wells has a young fresh voice and the imagery of her words is astounding!
Good read!" />

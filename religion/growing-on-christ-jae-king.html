  <title>Growing on Christ - Jae King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing in Christ will increase your understanding of many of the basic principles of the Christian faith. Faith was the enabling factor that propelled many common, ordinary men to become heroes in the Bible. You will learn from the beginning why so many over the centuries have put their faith and trust in God and his son Jesus Christ. This book will open the foundation for prayer and the principles of praise and worship. Prayer will lead you into a life of devotion and praise and worship will become a passion for you in your quest to please God. You will realize from the readings about salvation and being justified in Christ. Salvation is a divine plan from God and justification a gift that only Jesus could give. You can use this book as a catalyst to seek spiritual gifts and learn some of the principles of healing. Yes spiritual gifts are still available to the believers of Jesus Christ today. Oral Roberts once said that Healing is the childrens bread meaning that that supernatural healing is for the children of God. Growing in Christ will lead you to understand how amazing the love of God is for mankind when you read about the grace of God. You will appreciate this book as a valuable tool to add to your library and to use as reference manual for your future studies.&lt;/p&gt;" />

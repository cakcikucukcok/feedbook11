The shell, or outer story, is the trade in fraudulent and illicit genuine antiquities, with her focus being on the fraudulent ones. That's the first "f" - the "forgery." It's quickly united with "faith" and "fundamentalism."<br /><b><i>Unholy Business: A True Tale of Faith, Greed and Forgery ...</i></b> | UNHOLY BUSINESS: A True Tale of Faith, Greed &amp; Forgery in the Holy Land by Nina Burleigh There are two different types of people in the world, those who want to know, and those who want to believe.--Attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Unholy Business - Nina Burleigh</a> </h3></p><hr/>

  <title>Wherever You Are In The World You Are An Inventor - Liam M Birkett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Easy to understand&lt;br /&gt;
This book was written as a response to many requests made to me over my years associated with inventions, devising trade marks, creating brands and utilising intellectual property from a sales and marketing perspective. The calls came from clients, readers of my articles, listeners to my radio contributions and especially the many attendees at my seminars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Entertaining and accessible&lt;br /&gt;
All these groups told me repeatedly that they wanted a more detailed record of what I had said or written. Time and again, people came to me saying that my approach was entertaining, easy to understand, and my delivery made the subject matter accessible to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Relevant internationally&lt;br /&gt;
The general principles of Intellectual Property (IP) rights are similar internationally. This is because IP law has largely been harmonised, for example in the EU. However, there will always be exceptions to the general rule in some jurisdictions. Because many of my talks and seminars are given in Ireland, the content frequently cites Irish examples. Nevertheless, these examples are relevant to international situations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About Author&lt;br /&gt;
Liam Birkett is changing the way many people and firms do business. No matter the size of the firm or the budget, his refreshing enthusiasm, insight and expertise create business ideas and turns them into reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Liam began in office management before moving into sales and marketing. He was involved in the launch of Mace and VG group in Ireland. His experience extends into wholesale, retail, cash and carry, and consultancy on a national and international basis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He worked for advertising agency O&amp;rsquo;Kennedy Brindley Advertising (which became Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi) before co-founding design and marketing consultancy Bernardini, Birkett &amp;amp; Gardner Ltd. For more than 20 years, his firm was responsible for corporate identities and marketing initiatives for blue-chip companies and SMEs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His unique skill is to see matters from a design, marketing and sales perspective. Coupled with his comprehensive understanding of intellectual property, Liam can generate a unique way of looking at existing or new business opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many people have good ideas, products or services but do not have the ability to commercialise them. In the absence of a worthwhile promotional fund, they cannot obtain essential media exposure. Liam can show them how to do it. Being the creator of brands and an inventor himself, he has &amp;lsquo;been there, done that&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Liam is sought out as a pundit on intellectual property matters and has been repeatedly asked to speak to university classes, business groups and professional bodies, both national and international.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is a consultant expert to the European Commission Framework Programme and past president of the Society of Designers in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Wasted . . . Maybe - Katherine [Mk] Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MK entertains readers with a captivating narrative that includes the actions of Asian thugs, backroom drug trafficking, prostitution, and the sexual proclivities of key figures who havent come to terms with their closeted lifestyles. A glimpse at this darker side seems a nod to the film noir stylings of early 40s and 50s Hollywood, which oft times includes a criminal element and an undercurrent of moral conflict.
- The US Review of Books 
Glimpse into the male dominated 1950s where men ruled and alluring women beguiled while trying to position themselves into lives of comfort. Melodys faade of elegance and confidence hides her rapidly plummeting lifestyle until she has to face her realities. Gorgeous, sweet, trusting Lara climbs out of depravity but may be heading toward a total relapse. Hard-edged Carla, the bitter conniver, tries to outsmart one and all in order to be the elusive winner. Power players, the movie star, the international singing sensation, the wunderkind executive headhunter, the dynamic attorney and the nearly legitimate underworld fixer are caught up in the manipulative, handsome Asian-American honchos exploitation schemes. Underlying the erotic dark sides, impossible dreams and demanding demons is the need to accept their own vulnerabilities, to know how to take risks whether with money, sex, love, drugs or even integrity. Giving in to ones weakness can lead to true love or to downfall. The takers become the losers. True love is lurking around all the time, but it must be earned. Can they do that? Can any one of them make the right choices? Find out." />

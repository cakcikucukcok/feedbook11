  <title>Fulfilled - Dr. Anna Yusim, Eben Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you living the life you thought you always wanted but feel that something is still missing? Do you think you should be happier than you are, considering all that you have? Have you achieved your professional or personal goals but still feel racked with insecurities, anxiety, or depression . . . and can&#39;t figure out why? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Psychiatrist Anna Yusim knows just how you feel. Not only has she struggled with these feelings herself, but she has also worked with patients upon patients who have expressed the same bewildering concern: they have everything they&#39;ve always wanted, and yet deep down they don&#39;t feel fulfilled. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Determined to help herself and her patients, Dr. Yusim spent more than fifteen years studying and conducting research and came to a startling conclusion: this lingering feeling of dissatisfaction coincides with spiritual neglect. Once she helped her patients address their spiritual and psychological needs, she saw radical improvements in their happiness levels and quality of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now science is catching up with her innovative approach to therapy as groundbreaking medical research and studies substantiate what Dr. Yusim and many others have suspected for years: spirituality is a powerful path to healing. Drawing from the best in Western medicine, as well as teachings from Kabbalah, Buddhism, and shamanistic traditions, Dr. Yusim has developed a program that marries empirical science and spirituality to help you: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Discover your life&#39;s true purpose &lt;br&gt; Eliminate self-defeating patterns and roadblocks that are keeping you from living your most authentic life &lt;br&gt; Understand the scientific underpinnings behind &quot;answered prayers&quot; and &quot;random coincidences&quot;-and why having faith in them can change your outlook for the better &lt;br&gt; Appreciate how consciousness shapes your reality and how to harness this understanding to live a life of abundance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Filled with exercises, guided meditations, fascinating scientific research, and inspiring success stories, &lt;i&gt;Fulfilled&lt;/i&gt; integrates the best of Western medicine with universal spiritual principles to help you find more meaning, more joy, and more fulfillment in your life." />

          &lt;strong&gt;Ford Hyatt thought he was done.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was all set to give up on himself and on Project Justice. Then Robyn Jasperson walks back into his life. His former bad-girl crush looks better than ever and needs his help getting a case overturned. Robyn&#39;s got an ex-husband in jail, a murdered son and nowhere else to turn. Ford let her down before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now he can find the truth, set matters straight and redeem himself. And time is running out. If he fails, she has everything to lose. If he wins, he has everything to gain, including Robyn&#39;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;

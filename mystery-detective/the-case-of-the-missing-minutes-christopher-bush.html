  <title>The Case of the Missing Minutes - Christopher Bush</title>

The time was eight minutes to eight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludovic Travers is approached by his sister after tales of strange doings and horrible night shrieks in a country house called Highways. Travers makes an investigatory visit, where he finds stabbed to death the bizarre old man who was living at the house with his 10-year-old granddaughter. Among the prime suspects are the child&amp;rsquo;s tutor, and a classical pianist who happens to be in the village on holiday.

  <title>Our Lord’S Beacon - William T. Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Then the Laity will become more noble in character as were the Bereans, and with maturity, combine their faith with the Word allowing them to recognize when the leaders teach in ignorance of the Word. (acts 17:11, Heb. 4:2). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Lords Beacon: The Elementary Teachings of Christ Jesus&lt;/i&gt; digs into the fundamental teachings of the doctrine of Christ Jesus. Many writings about the basics of &lt;i&gt;Christianity&lt;/i&gt; have been published but without full knowledge of these six elementary truths, while using the meat of Gods Word, full maturity un a Christians life will never be attained. If we as Christians are stuck in the milk, in Gods eyes we are still yet infants since we are not yet acquainted with the teachings of the righteous. Furthermore, solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. One cannot use/digest solid food until one can fully digest the milk, and only if God permits it. (Heb. 5:13-14). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is todays church truly mature? Can todays church possibly be conducting itself and understanding good and evil as an infant, using only the milk of Gods Word? Is the world influencing the church more than the church is influencing the world? Can everything in todays church be traced back to &lt;i&gt;The Elementary Teachings of Christ Jesus&lt;/i&gt;?" />

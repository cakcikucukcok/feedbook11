  <title>The Remington Registry of Outstanding Professionals 2011-2012 - J Alex Ficarra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Undoubtedly growing up during the Vietnam War, water gate and gas shortages can have a profound effect on a child. Also being the son of immigrant parents most certainly can lead to a traumatizing clash of cultures and the understanding of right and wrong. With that being said the Remington Company gave me the honor of a lifetime by letting me express my thoughts in unison with telling the brilliant stories of professionals around the world. As I wrote endlessly 24 hours a day I realized that our world is full of hope and real promise. I realized that it wasnt about war, ideology and the pursuit of global domination. I realized that in the pages of this great book great things were about to happen if only these stories can be made public. I realized that I had the opportunity of a lifetime by expressing the Humanitarian attributes that these professionals continually made. After many years of writing I realized that the Remington Company had a distinct and noble purpose and perhaps we could not change the present but we could certainly try to change our future. With that we created our Mentorship Program which gets these prolific stories out to the children. We wrote the stories with zest but never crossed the line of respect or dignity. We wished to capture the hearts of our audience and prove to them that giving was not an option but more so our duty as life forms on our planet. Today our book has a theme Inspiring the youth of America. This theme was our way of telling the world Lets hold hands and prepare our children for a better life. today I continue to write for the Registry. My life has irrevocably changed for the better. I volunteer for any thing all the time. I enjoy moments of quiet and the appreciation of our environment. I read these biographies in amazement as everyone else does and it never seems to get uneventful. Either way I sincerely hope you enjoy these biographies and use them to strengthen your spirit and confidence about our existence as a species on this planet. I patiently wait for divine intervention in order to write my next biography and am happy to serve the brilliant members of the Remington Registry of Outstanding Professionals." />

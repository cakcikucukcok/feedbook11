  <title>I am Aspiengirl: The Unique Characteristics, Traits and Gifts of Females on the Autism Spectrum - Tania Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why she says she feels different to her peers? Wondered why life seems challenging for her? Her peers seem to gracefully and naturally meet their milestones, yet she has reached some developmental milestones early and some late. She may have spoken and read early, asking an endless array of questions. Maybe at age four she was teaching herself to read as you drove down the road by reading street signs. She may have been an overly active child, had sensory issues, or had a speech delay. You knew she was bright from early on, with a sprinkle of some anxiety, social and eating issues, yet the professionals just cannot find an explanation that completely fits her. She may be very artistic, whether she sings, draws, paints, or writes, at times, too mature for her age. Yet, she struggles socially and emotionally, acting and appearing younger than her peers. She may be ten years old now, yet none of your research completely fits her or maybe you have just now come across some information on females that completely makes sense to you. Maybe she is &quot;Aspien&quot;, a young female with Asperger Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism. She has a unique constellation of super-abilities, strengths and challenges. She may feel or say that she is from another Planet, Planet Aspien®. If you are looking for a book on the often perplexing and unique female Autism Spectrum traits, then this is the book for you. Watch for &quot;I am AspienWoman&quot;, coming soon." />

  <title>Saying Goodbye - Jean C. West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Saying Goodbye: My Spiritual Journey through Death and Dying dares to face the basic reality that so much of modern culture strains itself to deny: everyone who lives will die. The hope and the encouragement come, not in pretending that death will not happen, but in shaping the way in which one says goodbye to friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jean C. West, who sat with her husband and her siblings as they died, draws upon both her experiences and her research to present a guide to assist all who find themselves in the position making or witnessing end-of-life goodbyes. Her advice covers the circumstances of those who are dying and of others who accompany loved ones in their dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Saying Goodbye describes the common landmarks one encounters in a journey through death and dying. It presents special guidance for circumstances in which children are dying. It talks through the sorts of plans one can make in advance of death. It consoles and supports individuals during the time after a loved ones death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Saying Goodbye: My Spiritual Journey through Death and Dying recognizes that while each persons circumstances and perspective are unique, the common elements of the human experience of death and dying can provide the foundation for saying goodbye and for journeying through times of human mortality.&lt;/p&gt;" />

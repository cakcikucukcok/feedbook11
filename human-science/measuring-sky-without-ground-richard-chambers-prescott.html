Measuring Sky Without Ground
&quot;No one can write as you do without it being forged in the bliss of Her divine fire, no one comes to Her knowledge without being prepared to offer themselves in the flames... only they know the passion of this surrender!  Beautiful poet, i salute you, for you are doing the work, the great work of preparing the vessel so She may flow through... oh how i too ardently long for there to be nothing left of me but the Goddess!
I appreciated DRAGON SIGHT deeply... i have absorbed it and pay homage to you for not only attempting but actually executing such a work.  Thank goodness, thank Goddess , for beings like you.

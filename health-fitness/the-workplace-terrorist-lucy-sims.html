  <title>The Workplace Terrorist - Lucy Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Terrorism is a serious thing at any time. For many people, its something they face every day. Try thinking of dealing with negative people as dealing with a terrorist. As over exaggerated as this may sound, the adverse effects a negative person can have on our lives can cause lifelong damage.
In The Workplace Terrorist: The Passport to Keep You from Becoming a Workplace Hostage. Take the Sims Flight, author Lucy Sims helps you find excitement in your job and your life. Sims took the experiences of catastrophic events and using the metaphor of an airplane flight, developed a motivational tool to show what can happen if we allow terrorism in our workplaces or lives. We dont think much about how we are affected by the negative actions of others and how this is a type of terrorism. The highs and lows of an airplane flight bring home how frightening these experiences can be.
No matter what you do in life, the principles found in The Workplace Terrorist: The Passport to Keep You from Becoming a Workplace Hostage. Take the Sims Flight can be applied. Think of terrorism as something to get rid of and something to never be around you, your workplace, your home, and so on. How you view negative people will change when you understand how they can affect your everyday life. And perhaps most important, youll learn how not to be a workplace terrorist." />

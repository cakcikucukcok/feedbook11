  <title>The 7 Footer Crays &#39;N&#39; Crazy Tales - Karren McMahon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 7 Footer  Crays n Crazy Tales is the life story of my father, John McMahon a.k.a Caca Jack.  West Australian born but of Irish decent he carried with him the resilience and determination inherit in his family to survive and prosper at all costs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His story takes the reader from his moments as a young boy with all the experiences of being in the Australian hood during the 1940s and 50s to the moment of his passing in September 2011.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A large part of his life was anchored in Cervantes, a small coastal crayfishing town close to the famous Pinnacle Desert in Western Australia.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He was many things but especially he was an untameable man of the sea with no greater passion than to go fishing.  His obsession almost cost him his life on many occasions yet it fed his determination to try and outsmart the unpredictability of the Indian Ocean.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Between many encounters with the law, narrow life escapes, unexpected emotional challenges and living life hard there was little time to relax.  This would lead him through to an end reflective of such a life." />

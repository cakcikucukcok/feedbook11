      <meta name="description" content="Alzheimers, now what?
Joy, a beautiful and rather affluent lady of eighty years is diagnosed with the Alzheimers Decease. 
Driving her automobile, no longer being an option, forces the family to find the right help for her condition.
Joy is used to getting her way no matter what, which labels her as difficult, demanding, often by screaming, and at times even physical.
Care givers come and go.
Loving a challenge and knowing the family, the position was offered and I accepted.
Bless this woman, having to deal with her condition and depression, confusion and anger, by not being able to live her glamorous life as usual.
Joy is a member of several country clubs and exudes in being recognized and waited on. She is in her element until this also fades away.
Falls, broken bones, wheelchairs and walkers are taking their turn with visits to doctors and hospitals. Tough as she is, Joy is surviving it all.
Not being able to recall her memories and friends, Joy emerges as a gracious, kind and caring, elderly and beautiful Lady." />

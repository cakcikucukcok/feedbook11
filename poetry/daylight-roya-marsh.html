  <title>dayliGht - Roya Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;dayliGht &lt;/i&gt;is a dazzling collection of poems from a necessary new voice, at once a clarion call for stories of Black women and a rebuke of broken notions of sexuality and race.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Roya Marsh was considered &quot;tomboy passing.&quot; With an affinity for baggy clothes, cornrows, and bandanas, she came of age in an era when the wide spectrum of gender and sexuality was rarely acknowledged or discussed. She knew she was &quot;different,&quot; her family knew she was &quot;different,&quot; but anything outside of the heteronorm was either disregarded or disparaged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her stunning debut, written in protest to an absence of representation, Marsh recalls her early life and the attendant torments of a butch Black woman coming of age in America. In lush, powerful, and vulnerable verses, &lt;i&gt;dayliGht&lt;/i&gt; unpacks traumas to unearth truths, revealing a deep well of resilience, a cutting sense of irony, and an astonishing fresh talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />

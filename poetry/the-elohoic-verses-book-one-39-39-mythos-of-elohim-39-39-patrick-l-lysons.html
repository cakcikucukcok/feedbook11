  <title>The Elohoic Verses Book One &#39;&#39; Mythos of Elohim&#39;&#39; - Patrick L. Lysons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What is a &quot;mythos&quot;?: a &quot;story, speech, or song&quot; that celebrates a sacred narrative. A mythos can be a play, a film, an opera, a narrative within a narrative; above all, a mythopoeic vehicle. A musical coda. A mythologem. A poem. A song that won&#39;t go away you hum on your way to somewhere else. Or simply a dream narrative where certain sacred themes repeat themselves throughout human history.   &lt;P&gt;The poems in this first book of the Elohoic trilogy verses were written during a ten year period (1989-99)in rural areas throughout the American Southwest. The narrative begins with an invitation, an invocation, to step into &quot;poetic light&quot; and concludes with the seeming death of the poetic/philosopher persona; along the way, the persona encounters the character of Jesus and his opposite: the Maker of the World-Iaoldaboath-but the poetic character in the mythos haunts certain mystic types: the Lost Pilgrim &quot;still stuck on Eckhart&#39;s prayer&quot; encountering Dante in Purgatory; a lover, friend, priest, and shaman. In an enigmatic style, the brevity is as sharp as a Zen master&#39;s silence where existence is seen as a poetic experiment in negation, a mimetic deconstruction--thus,in the facing of death an acceptance of death; the stirring of another kind of experience and Being in heart and mind. The poems at times elevate a prophetic and hortatory Voice-its language firmly grounded in an ancient and sacred poetic tradition. But the poetry itself, as poetry, remains informed by an Other; inspired by Kierkegaard&#39;s essay &quot;The God as Teacher and Savior&quot; (from which the excerpt is quoted)the poems proceed in a loose narrative form. It tells the story of a poetic risk-taker who is near death from a mountain climbing accident. He is remembering a dream he dreamt at a point from which his life has already ended. That essential material--the emptying of the contents of the dream--becomes the &quot;mythos&quot; of the poetry. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; Humphrey Bogart (as Sam Spade) best addresses the mysterious nature of the mythos in the last lines of the film &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. When asked &quot;What is it?&quot; Spade responds: &quot;It&#39;s the stuff dreams are made of.&quot;   &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note:  The name &quot;Elohim&quot; honors the Elohoic tradition of poetry and songs found in the Bible whose Hebrew name took the form El-o-him (as one of the Names for God) in the Psalms, for example, and in Ecclesiastes, among 9 other books classified as &quot;The Writings&quot;, including Proverbs.  &lt;P&gt;For a list of literary sources alluded to in this book, please E-mail the author.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>A Short Book on Child Sexual Abuse (and how men can overcome the effects of it) - Dr Ashley Conway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of people in the UK are directly affected by Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), and probably at least the same number again will have their lives adversely impacted by the indirect effects of CSA - as partners, children and other family members of the abused person. In this short book for male sufferers, clinical psychologist Dr Ashley Conway describes the incidence and effects of CSA and outlines pathways to help victims - and those close to them - deal with their feelings and promote healing. Conway writes in simple, easy language and after each section offers a bullet point summary of the key issues. He frames the discussion with case studies based on his years of experience in dealing with men who have worked through their problems and thrived after suffering abuse in childhood. Introducing the Therapy Toolkits, a new series of short, user-friendly, 15,000-word books designed to help you confront the issues that are holding you back, and to enable you to effect lasting change." />

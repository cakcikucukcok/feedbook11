  <title>Love Unconditional - Emily Quick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After facing a difficult transition from the economic downturn and then losing her family in a car accident at the ranch that previous summer, Sarah struggles with her faith. Her uncle Charlie and aunt Robin see Sarahs need to return to her faith and do the only thing they can think to do, invite her back up to the ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan envies the stability and life of his brother Mike. Being from a wealthy family, girls are only interested in Alans status. Mike wants to see Alan succeed at more than the MD he has been working so hard for. Inviting Alan to join his family for a leisurely weekend at a ranch, he hopes Alan can enjoy himself a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon meeting Sarah, Alan sees something in her that he has never seen in a woman before and is instantly drawn to her. Sarahs cousin Jenny, however, isnt about to let Sarah take away the guy that she has her eyes fixed on. She feels that Sarah has had her opportunity to be happy, and its now her turn to be the one to have the life shes dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan discovers that spending time at the ranch was the best decision he could have made and now knows exactly what he wants in life. But can he persuade the woman he is interested in into giving him a chance at her heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />

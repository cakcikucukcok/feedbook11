  <title>Almost Home - Toni Poll-Sorensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have moved a few times from the place where I was born. And I have done the tourist thing about wanting to own a piece of paradise. I have had friends come and go in my life. Sometimes they moved or died. Sometimes they just move on or away from our friendship.
This collection of poems is about what occurs in the process of searching for a home. Some of us find home in another person. Some find home in a place that we may or may not inhabit. Many of us make a home in a house we call our own.
My own home is not where I was born. It is not where I went to college. It is not my first house. It is not where I raised my children. It is not even where I currently live. I explored many questions that I had about where home was as I wrote these poems. None of these poems answer the questions, but all of them point toward a way of finding a special place that is almost home." />

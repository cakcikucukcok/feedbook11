  <title>Beyond the Grave: Love and Immortality - Floyd Vernon Chandler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What really happens to human consciousness at death?  How might love and immortality be related?  What is purgatory and do most religions teach the concept of purgatory?  What is spirituality?  Is the essence of the mystery we call God the same for the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jew, and Muslim?  Is it more important what my religion teaches me to believe, or is it more important that my religion enables me to become more loving and compassionate?  How might one practice a reverence for life by our food choices?  How do we balance work and spirituality?  How do we balance spirituality and social-justice work?  In this collection of sermons and reflections, Floyd Vernon Chandler suggests that there are many valid spiritual paths to Enlightenment and Holiness. Understanding the mystery we call God is akin to the story of five blind men touching different parts of a huge elephant. Each man&#39;s description and understanding of the elephant will vary based upon the location of his touch. The importance of any religion is determined by how much our respective spiritual paths lead us to grow in love and compassion for one another and for all other forms of life on this planet.  The sermon and reflections found in Beyond the Grave: Love and Immortality express a Universalist theology that all souls will eventually be reunited with the mystery we call God. Inherent in this collection of writings is the belief that there is truth in all religions and that there are many valid spiritual paths. No religious dogma or ideology has a monopoly on truth." />

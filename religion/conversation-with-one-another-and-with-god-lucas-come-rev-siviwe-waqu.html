  <title>Conversation with One Another and with God - Lucas Come, Rev. Siviwe Waqu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spiritual maturity should manifest (Translate, reflect) in ones day-to-day
Social life. This opening line by Lucas Come sets the tone for the pages
ahead. It sets the tone for the journey you are about to embark on. It may
sound as if the book is about an inward journey in which we are to absorb
and yet the book is about sharing and giving as we receive. The life of the
disciples is exactly about this. Jesus took time to have conversations with
his disciples and with the people he encountered. In this book Lucas seeks
to take us to the basics and the basis of life. We are people who are created
to be in community and to be a community. This is a concept that has been
lost in the 21st Century. Even though our faith calls us to be a people, we
have instead chosen to be influenced by the world.
The virtue today is to be the best at the expense of others. It is an isolating
and lonely way of doing life. Conversations with one another and with
God is carefully designed to call us out of our shell to share our stories
and maybe only then will we have meaningful connections. This is the
first thing that I want to bring forth as you begin to read this enriching
bookbeing called out.
The book itself is realistic as it tackles some of the issues that we deal with
in life as ordinary believers who seek to be faithful disciples.
Have you ever pondered the question of focusing on God? Is this not
something we struggle to do most of the time? Richard J. Foster knows
this truth as he reminds us that the world is always screaming trying to
draw our attention. He says, In a culture where the landscape is dotted
with shrines to the Golden Arches and an assortment of Pizza Temples,
fasting seems out of place, out of step with the times. (Foster R.J.: 1978:
Celebration of Discipline: The path to spiritual growth: 41) And yet on the
other hand Jesus is this gentle voice that does not nag; this voice that is
often drowned by consumerism, selfish promises, momentary success and
many other things that offer us false hope.
14 Foreword
Lucas invites us to focus on positive things. Those things that enable life
not just for us, but others as well. This is another profound lesson for us
especially in the Southern Africa today. For us to grow deeper in love with
God we need to grow deeper in love for others as well. This way of doing
life helps us to wipe our tear off and begin to see other peoples tears. We
often focus on ourselves and end up drowning in our own sorrow and
misery without any sense of being aware of what we can still do; not only
for ourselves, but equally motivated to see our potential in journeying with
others.
The life of Jesus is marked by a journey that takes him to the people to
be with the people. It is marked with people being drawn to Jesus. Jesus is
receptive, embracing and loving.
I enjoy Lucas perspective of Jesus as a better place. Do we ever get to
a place of taking Jesus seriously such that our lives are founded on him?
What would our lives look like if we were to put Jesus at the centre of how
we do life? Could it be that we would begin to treat one another graciously?
Could it mean that we would allow justice to flourish and inhumane habits
shrink to almost non-existent? We often say, We are made in the image of
God. Do we really understand the depth and the breadth of this phrase?
It means God first and God last. It means living within the presence of
God. It means living not as we please, but as God would be honoured. It
means taking God seriously than wanting to see how much God takes us
seriously. We live in a culture that seeks recognition as if God sometimes
forgets about us. And yet the reality of Gods holiness comes from God not
thinking God, but you and I.
Therefore God will not promise to love us and then the next minute hurt
us. God never plays games with us. God takes us seriously all the time.

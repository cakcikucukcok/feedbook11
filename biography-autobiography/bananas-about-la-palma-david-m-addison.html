  <title>Bananas About La Palma - David M. Addison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a song for every occasion, the author embarks on another adventure, this time to La Palma in the Canary Islands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having learnt from previous encounters that neighbours are not conducive to good holidays, he elects this time to stay in a remote country cottage. If he imagined this would avoid encountering irritating people and ensure a trouble-free, idyllic, romantic holiday with his long-suffering wife, he was sadly mistaken. His gift for putting his foot in it, as usual, results in a series of tight scrapes, excruciatingly embarrassing for him, but which provides the reader with a vicarious sense of pleasure, not to mention Schadenfreude, appropriately enough, for Germans seem to cross the writers path with amazing regularity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow in the authors footsteps, let him be your guide as he explores every aspect of this island, which, he concludes, is one of the most spectacular he has ever visited, yet one of the least visited in the Canarian archipelago. Along the way, seen from his personal and offbeat perspective, he will undoubtedly inform you, certainly entertain you and hopefully persuade you - you must visit this island before you die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before he dies, the author considers some possible solutions before staring eternity in the face&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

  <title>Empty Thoughts from an Empty Head - Tony Sandy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book and the preceding one (written at the same time) arose out, out of the urge in Tony Sandy to, try to understand why his language teaching series was not taking off. It also came about as he tried to make sense of the world he found himself in, as well as basic questions about reality (covered mostly in the first book). This particular volume has got lost in meditations on various subjects and the complexities that come about from interlinking related ideas. This occurs because experience, through the medium of time, discloses awareness of their connection: The novice mind floats all over the place,like a butterfly - The experienced mind cuts through everything, like a hot knife through butter or a diamond drill through glass (We take things apart to understand them and put them back together, to make them work). It is hoped that this book will stimulate thought at least in those that it doesn&amp;#39;t provide answers for and that those it does help, will in turn pass those ideas onto others for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;" />

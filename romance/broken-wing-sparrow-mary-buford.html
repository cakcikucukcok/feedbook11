  <title>Broken Wing Sparrow - Mary Buford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fr. Lance Tomas was the ideal flawless priest, whos youthfulness and personality gained him favor in a small Wisconsin town; that is, until an act of God took his memory away, and being a priest, or himself was more of a challenge than a lifestyle. Taking the necessary small steps to regain who he was, Fr Lance Tomas goes on a journey, of his past, the priesthood, and his region; now seeing an entirely new world; instead of pleasantries and smiles; he now sees a world in need of God. Now more determined than ever to regain his knowledge of the priesthood, he struggles with his own thoughts &amp; questions, while befriending a rosary maker, single mother named Tammy. He finds her to be a part of his past, his present, and his future. He soon realizes that he is drawn to her, almost attracted in away, to her religious views and enjoyable personality. Will he be forced to choose between her, the priesthood... or with the stroke of the Popes pen, will he be able to have both?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Figure Studies: Poems - Claudia Emerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poet Claudia Emerson begins  &lt;i&gt;Figure Studies&lt;/i&gt; with a twenty-five-poem lyric sequence called &quot;All Girls School,&quot; offering intricate views of a richly imagined boarding school for girls. Whether focused on a lesson, a teacher, or the girls themselves as they collectively &quot;school&quot; -- or refuse to -- the poems explore ways girls are &quot;trained&quot; in the broadest sense of the word.&quot;Gossips,&quot; the second section, is a shorter sequence narrated by women as they talk about other women in a variety of isolations; these poems, told from the outside looking in, highlight a speculative voicing of all the gossips cannot know. In &quot;Early Lessons,&quot; the third section, children narrate as they also observe similarly solitary women, the children&#39;s innocence allowing them to see in farther than the gossips can.

But she was wearing a blue-sequined negligee &lt;br&gt;and blonde wig, so they helped themselves to her on a lark -- drunken impulse -- and for years kept her &lt;br&gt;leaning in a corner, beside an attic window, rendered invisible. The dusk &lt;br&gt;was also perpetual in the garage below,punctuated only by bare bulbs hung close &lt;br&gt;over the engines. An oily grime coated the walls, and a decade of calendars promoted &lt;br&gt;stock-car drivers, women in dated swimsuits, even their bodies out of fashion. Radio distorted &lt;br&gt;there; cigarette smoke moaned, the pedal steel conceding to that place a greater, echoing &lt;br&gt;sorrow. So, lame, forgotten prank, she remained,back turned forever to the dark storage&lt;br&gt;behind her, gaze leveled just above anyone&#39;s who could have looked up &lt;br&gt;to mistake in the cast of her face fresh longing -- her expression still reluctant figure for it.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Tales from the Mom Front - Rebecca Martorella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Tales from the Mom Front&lt;/I&gt; offers an insightful and engaging look at the early years of parenthood from the perspective of a first-time mother. Author and family therapist Rebecca Martorella chronicles her journey from pregnancy to preschool with a dose of realism and wit that reads like a conversation with a good friend.&lt;/P&gt;
Unlike advice books that outline what to expect from parenthood, Martorella shares the unexpected moments that have parents everywhere wondering, &quot;is it just me?&quot; Stories include:&lt;/P&gt;
Building Baby Furniture-The First Parenting Challenge
Breasts, Bottles, How Do You Work These Things?!
Family Vacation is an Oxymoron
First Date with the Babysitter
Eeek! Daddy&#39;s in Charge!&lt;/p&gt;
and more. She reveals her mistakes and victories and encourages parents to trust their instincts, laugh at their blunders, and release themselves from the pressure to be a &quot;perfect&quot; parent.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Tales from the Mom Front&lt;/I&gt; began as a newspaper column that earned praise from new and experienced parents and grandparents alike. Parents find a sympathetic voice in the author and are relieved to learn that they are not alone in their daily confusion and joy.&lt;/P&gt;" />

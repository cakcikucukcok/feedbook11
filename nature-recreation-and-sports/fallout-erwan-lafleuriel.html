  <title>Fallout - Erwan Lafleuriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The year was 1997 and &lt;i&gt;Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game&lt;/i&gt; had just been released by Interplay.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book looks back at the entire Fallout saga, tells the story of the series&#39; birth, retraces its history and deciphers its mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The perfect book to discover and understand the origins of &lt;i&gt;Fallout&lt;/i&gt;, with the saga&#39;s genesis and the decryption of each of his episodes !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXTRACT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The intro music and the end credits were the final main components of this hybrid post-apocalyptic/50s ambiance. Initially, Brian Fargo wanted to signal &lt;i&gt;Fallout&lt;/i&gt;’s inspiration with &lt;i&gt;Warriors of the Wasteland&lt;/i&gt;, by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, but when he heard The Ink Spots, he changed his mind and loved the result. The first choice was &lt;i&gt;I Don’t Want To Set The World On Fire&lt;/i&gt; by this group of crooners from the 1930s/40s, but unfortunately the high cost made it impossible to acquire the rights. But while browsing an extensive list of tracks from the era, the team found that &lt;i&gt;Maybe&lt;/i&gt;, by the same group, had almost the same sound-with the added bonus of being cheap! The lyrics are about a break-up, from the point of view of the person being left behind: &quot;Maybe you’ll think of me when you are all alone/ Then maybe you’ll ask me to come back again&quot;. Leonard Boyarsky notes that, &quot;It worked with the intro [and the ending]&quot;, referring to the ending with the betrayal and lonely exile of &lt;i&gt;Fallout&lt;/i&gt;’s hero. &quot;It felt like it was this genius plan we had [...] but it was only later that we decided to kick [the player] out of the Vault. I feel like this is a metaphor for the whole game: it looks like we had a better picture in mind than we did, it just came out of the things we were doing&quot;." />

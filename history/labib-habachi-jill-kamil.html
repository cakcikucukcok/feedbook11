  <title>Labib Habachi - Jill Kamil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Labib Habachi, Egypt&#39;s most perceptive and productive Egyptologist, was marginalized for most of his career, only belatedly receiving international recognition for his major contributions to the field. In &lt;em&gt;Labib Habachi: The Life and Legacy of an Egyptologist&lt;/em&gt;, Jill Kamil presents not only a long-overdue biography of this important scholar, but a survey of Egyptian archaeology in the twentieth century in which Habachi&#39;s work is measured against that of his best-known contemporaries among them Selim Hassan, Ahmed Fakhry, Abdel Moneim Abu Bakr, and Gamal Mokhtar.
The account of Habachi&#39;s major discovery, the Sanctuary of Heqaib on Elephantine in 1946, was shelved by Egypt&#39;s Antiquities Department for thirty years. When it was finally released for publication, it became the subject of a heated controversy between Habachi and a western scholar that was never resolved.
To construct her picture of Labib Habachi, Jill Kamil draws on a wide range of sources, including a long personal acquaintance with the subject. Tracing the arc of Habachi&#39;s career, Kamil sets his life&#39;s work in its full context, providing a valuable perspective on the development of Egyptian Egyptology and the sometimes fraught relationship between Egypt&#39;s scholars and the western archaeological establishment." />

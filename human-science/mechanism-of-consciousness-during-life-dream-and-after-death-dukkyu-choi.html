  <title>Mechanism of Consciousness During Life, Dream and After-Death - Dukkyu Choi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everybody understands the five consciousnesses which are recognized by the five organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin) contacting the five objects (color (light), sound, smell, taste, and tactile objects), respectively. To human being, even sentient being, that is not all. Everybody knows about the sixth consciousness, namely, mind. In Buddhism, the sixth consciousness is explained to be generated from contacting between the sixth organ and the sixth object (dharma). What is the sixth organ? What is the sixth object? No more detailed explanation in Buddhism yet. However, this book provides very clear understanding on the sixth organ, sixth object, and further, mechanism of all consciousnesses. Finally you will become to know about &quot;Who am I?&quot; and get Enlightenment. In addition, this book will contribute to the scientific progress on consciousness.  
One of the author&#39;s friends, Mr. Anjan Sen, Patent Attorney in Calcutta, reviewed about this book, &quot;I am really grateful to you for giving me this special opportunity to go through this excellent analytical and logically driven work of yours. You deserve special praise and credit for creating such a work inspite of your busy professional schedule which I found not only highly thought provoking but also directional and, most importantly, has been written in such a lucid form that would make it a ready treat for one and all to read and appreciate the discourse. I am overwhelmed by your stupendous efforts.&quot;" />

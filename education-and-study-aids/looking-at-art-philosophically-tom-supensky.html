      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to present to the reader a series of philosophical ideas that assist in understanding ones position in the world of art and some thinking on art and creativity intended to awaken the aesthetic aspects of making art.  There is no intention to review historical philosophical concepts, nor is there any specific inclusion of contemporary theories on art philosophy.  What is included are those philosophies important to the developing artist that are more commonplace in nature, often neglected in art education, yet vitally necessary to the true artist.  Finally, this book is intended to stimulate the reader into asking such questions as who am I, why art, and what is art.  It is hopeful that the reader finds an aesthetic foundation, a personal and honest place in the world of art." />

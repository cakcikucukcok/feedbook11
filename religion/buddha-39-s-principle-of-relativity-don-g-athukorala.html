  <title>Buddha&#39;s Principle of Relativity - Don G. Athukorala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buddhas Principle of Relativity  (Mind - Body  Stress)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will undoubtedly be bumping into the most philosophical of Buddhas teachings. The Principle of Relativity (&lt;em&gt;Paticcasamuppada&lt;/em&gt;) was His first set of guidelines for freedom from suffering. Buddha found a cure for mental disorder and decided to pass on the therapy to others. He was far ahead of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory remained puzzling for the past 1500 years or even more. However, after years of study, I think I have an answer  a scientific explanation. Eureka  I have found it. Buddhas philosophy is scientific, analytical and stands to reason. It reveals that we are the architects of our own problems  we created them. Find out how they can be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Paticcasamuppada (PS)&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I see it, &lt;em&gt;Paticc&lt;/em&gt;as&lt;em&gt;amuppada&lt;/em&gt; describes a biological process that takes place when a disturbance agitates a balanced state within the body. This doctrine specifically deals with an internal sensation (ignorance) causing the brain to generate effects, both mentally and physically. This process, however, applies to almost all instances in our daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it. You can see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ven Buddhaghosa misjudged the significance of PS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visuddhimagga&lt;/em&gt; (The Path of Purification) is regarded among Theravada Buddhists as the authority and a classic textbook on the Buddhas teachings dealing on abstract psychological concepts. Ven Buddhaghosas interpretation of the PS is regarded as standard. It obscures the truth but nevertheless, it has been accepted for the last 1500 years, for in yet another commentary &lt;em&gt;Sammohavinodani&lt;/em&gt; (Dispeller of Delusion) he describes PS as occurring in brief moments of time described as mind moments, but had nothing to say about it. Both commentaries are from the &lt;em&gt;Tripitaka&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Referring to this doctrine Ven Buddhaghosa says: it is inherently difficult to comment on PS as the ancients did (page 599 &lt;em&gt;Visuddhimagga&lt;/em&gt;)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth, a being, rebirth  linking, and &lt;em&gt;Paticcasamuppada&lt;/em&gt;, are four things very hard to see and difficult to teach. I find no footing for support and seem to founder in a sea. Whoever learns alertly this PS, will go from excellence to excellence and when perfected, he will then escape beyond the vision of the King of Death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heres another confusing quote: &lt;/strong&gt;(page 600)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhas teaching of PS is four fold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) From the beginning to the end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) From the middle, up to the end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) From the end, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) From the middle, down and to the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yet another; &lt;/strong&gt;(page 671)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining his interpretation of PS on a lifetime to lifetime basis, he quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is re-birth linking, which is consciousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is descent into the womb, which is mentality  materiality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is sensitivity which is sense base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is which is touched, which is contact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is what is felt, which is feeling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a clear misconception of Buddhas most insightful teaching proclaimed by Him soon after Enlightenment related to mind moments, for workings of the mind are Buddhas area of specialty. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent interpretations in his book by P.A. Payutto tilted Dependent Origination published by Buddhadhamma Foundation, Bangkok, Thailand and by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, also of Thailand, titled Dependent Origination shed doubts on to the validity of Ven Buddhaghosas interpretation, on a lifetime - to lifetime basis. They think that this may not be the case. So why continue?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>My Canvas - Cherry Sparks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Canvas is a collection of short stories that come together to create one. These are true stories based on a childs life, presented on coarse material, as seen through her eyes. Witness her struggle to understand lifes mysteries as she tries to fit into society, while basically raising her own self. 
Her story will make you laugh at some of the witty things she does to survive and fit in, while other instances will make you cry as she encounters things she cannot comprehend. Follow her journey into adulthood where early life experiences affect her self-esteem and decisions. 
This tale will jolt your memories back to your youth (especially if you ran the neighborhood and didn&#39;t get caught in mischievous acts) and above all, it will attest to basic desires as to what we all want and need: love and acceptance.
This piece will help teens and young adults speak up, and can also serve as a resource to help parents see the early signs of struggle in the lives of their children.
Feel free to go wherever your emotions direct you. Enjoy!" />

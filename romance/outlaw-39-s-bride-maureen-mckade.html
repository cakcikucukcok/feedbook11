  <title>Outlaw&#39;s Bride - Maureen McKade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;He was pure trouble for an honest woman...&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattie St. Clair knows that Clint Beaudry is a dangerous man the moment she sets eyes on him. Though she refuses the tall, dark, devastatingly handsome gunman a room in her boardinghouse, Mattie cannot turn him away a second time when he is carried to her door critically wounded. It&#39;s best if she just lets this troublesome stranger mend and move on- considering the unwanted feelings of desire he stirs up within her whenever he turns his deep, dangerous gaze her way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;She was more woman than a man could handle...&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This beautiful, strong-willed widow does something special to the hardened ex-marshal with her tender, healing touch -- tempting Clint to reconsider his vow never to let another woman into his perilous life. Despite her stubborn independence, Mattie&#39;s barely restrained passion tells him that she&#39;s been too long without a good man at her side. And since she and her young son both are in desperate need of a hero, what choice does Clint have -- except to become one?&lt;/p&gt;" />

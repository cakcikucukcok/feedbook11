  <title>The Unknown Courier - Ian Colvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On 30 April 1943, the drowned corpse of Major William Martin washed up on the coast of Spain. In what appeared to be a stroke of grave misfortune for the British, he was found to be carrying top-secret plans for the invasion of Italy. Truth, however, is often stranger than fiction: the plans, as well as the identity of the Major himself, were fake - part of a secret British intelligence ruse called &#39;Operation Mincemeat&#39;, which misled Hitler, causing him to divert his forces away from the Allied target of Sicily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist Ian Colvin became fascinated by tales of this audacious scheme and decided to investigate further. His search led him to Madrid, Gibraltar, Seville and finally to a grave at Huelva. The resulting book, originally published in 1953, is a breathtaking account of Colvin&#39;s journey, involving German ex-intelligence officers, Spanish generals, flamenco dancers and even a frogman pathologist specialising in drowned bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its thrilling insights into what turned out to be one of the most successful wartime deceptions ever attempted, &lt;i&gt;The Unknown Courier&lt;/i&gt; inspired Ben Macintyre&#39;s bestselling &lt;i&gt;Operation Mincemeat&lt;/i&gt;. Colvin&#39;s lively account looks beyond the military machinations and considers the mysterious identity of the unknown courier - who was this man who, after his own death, changed the course of the Second World War?&lt;/p&gt;" />

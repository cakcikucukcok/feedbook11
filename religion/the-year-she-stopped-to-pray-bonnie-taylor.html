  <title>The Year She Stopped to Pray - Bonnie Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a child, Bonnie Taylor was looking for a friend to play with, and she ended up kidnapped by her neighbor. Her innocence was stolen, and she was violently abused. She believed for many years that she fled from Mr. Blacks house unharmed, but she lived in deception. &lt;br /&gt;
A few months later, two men kidnapped her father from their home in the middle of the night, and he was shot as &lt;br /&gt;
he escaped. &lt;br /&gt;
After her Dads shooting, Bonnies family started to unravel, and she reached out to God for help. She believed that God rejected, abandoned, and betrayed her when the opposite of what she asked Him for happened. She came to her own conclusion, and she believed that God could not be trusted to love or take care of her. &lt;br /&gt;
After decades of trying to survive and failing miserably, she begged God to show her if He was real and if He loved her. He reached down and took her to Himself, and she was offered the opportunity of her lifetime. &lt;br /&gt;
She found healing, deliverance, and restoration as she went through a year of devastation and personal loss. The truth about her childhood was uncovered, and His love for her was discovered. &lt;br /&gt;
If youve ever wondered if God is real, or if you think you are too far gone to be reached, then this challenge to believe is for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Valhalla Forever - Austin Koepp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dive into the chaotic realm of Valhalla, where the greatest warriors of all time do battle in freedom to acquire ever higher measures of strength and fame. Life is generally cheerful as monsters, beasts, and other warriors provide an adventure for any worthy enough to seek it out. Times are changing in the land of Valhalla, however. In the east a disturbance is growing unabated and seeks to bring order to the land. This order is under one man, the Overlord, and no other will share power with him. The people of Valhalla did not take kindly to this intrusion, but their retaliation was met with utter destruction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Left broken from their defeat, the free men and women of the realm must now bow before the new power or do something even harder&amp;mdash;escape the past.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Follow Keane, one such warrior with a haunting past, as he travels over the rolling hills, high peaks, filthy swamps, and lush forest lands on an adventure to tie up loose ends and find his courage to hope again. Mixed in this turbulent time for Keane is an anomaly that no one has seen since the creation of Valhalla: a child. Michael.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Discover the magic and wonder within the pages of Valhalla Forever, and experience the struggles of Keane and Michael on their quest to find a home under the iron fist of the Overlord.&lt;/p&gt;" />

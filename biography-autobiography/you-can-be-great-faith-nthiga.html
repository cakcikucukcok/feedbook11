  <title>You Can Be Great! - Faith Nthiga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Lord said to Abraham, leave your country, your people and your father&#39;s household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you. I will make your name great and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse, and all the people of the earth will be blessed through you.&lt;br /&gt;
Genesis 12:13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know God told Abraham to walk away from his limitations, from living a simple, average, mediocre life into a life of greatness. This is what this book is all about. It can help transform everyday, regular people into greatness. The time of living without purpose is over.&lt;/p&gt;
In this book, you will discover:
What greatness is not.
True meaning of greatness.
Secrets to living a great life.
How an ordinary life can be turned into a wellspring of life.
How to get rid of what limits you.
How God can use you to be a blessing to generations.
And how to swim in the goodness of God and truly enjoy the great life He had in mind for you.
&lt;p&gt;As you obey Gods Word in this book, this is His promise to you: I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing!&lt;/p&gt;" />

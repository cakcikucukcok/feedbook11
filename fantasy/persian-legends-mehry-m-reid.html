  <title>Persian Legends - Mehry M. Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Persian folklore has been handed down from generation to generation for centuries in an effort to understand the past and pass on valuable lessons. Mehry M. Reid remembers sitting next to her grandmother, as she relayed captivating stories adapted to express her own feelings, hopes, and desires. These stories, which her grandmother first heard from her own mother and grandmother, began Reids fascination with the Persian legends and folktales that she has selected and reinterpreted in Persian Legends. 
As Reid transports readers of all ages on an unforgettable journey through ancient Persia, she highlights an eclectic group of characters comprised of people, animals, and objects that trace historical events, share legends most favored in Persian culture, and offer tales that convey their meanings in simple, often humorous ways. Take a walk with Princess Mina in the rose garden; listen to the kings storyteller; travel to the mountain of the forty virgins; discover the charm of the red diamond; and go to the crystal cave and drink from the wish fountain. 
Persian Legends: A Book of 101 Stories shares a memorable collection of legends and tales that provides a glimpse into Persian history, helps others appreciate ancient tales, and most importantly, preserves the legacy of folk literature for future generations." />

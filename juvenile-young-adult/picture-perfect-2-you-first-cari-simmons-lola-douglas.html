  <title>Picture Perfect #2: You First - Cari Simmons, Lola Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being one half of a BFF heart necklace is serious business&amp;#8212;and in the Picture Perfect series, each story tackles a tough friendship challenge. Through the ups and downs of life in middle school, through braces and boy bands, family feuds and fashion disasters, your best bud is there. But what happens when friendship suddenly gets complicated? Tween readers will adore these sweet, accessible stories about the power of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigi Stewart and her best friend, Finley, are always together. And everything they do, they document on the Wall&amp;#8212;their collage in Gigi&amp;#39;s room that holds layers and layers of memories&amp;#8212;from movie tickets to magazine ads to embarrassing baby photos&amp;#8212;and they never stop adding to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Gigi suggests they start planning their annual joint birthday blowout, Finn just doesn&amp;#39;t seem that into it. She&amp;#39;s more interested in extra soccer practice than choosing a party theme, or going to cooking class, or having sleepovers with Gigi. Gigi can&amp;#39;t help but be hurt, and she&amp;#39;s even more upset when she discovers that Finn&amp;#39;s been lying about what&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s been doing instead of hanging out with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gigi thought she and Finn would be friends forever&amp;#8212;but what if &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; is coming to an end?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>For Us Surrender Is Out of the Question - Mac McClelland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;There are bad things going on in Burma that you don&amp;#8217;t know about. There&amp;#8217;s a civil war (the world&amp;#8217;s longest running, in fact) raging between the government and ethnic rebels. Much of the United States&amp;#8217; heroin comes from there. And there&amp;#8217;s the small matter that America helped make it all possible with overt funding and the CIA&amp;#8217;s very first secret war. Of course, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t know any of this, because Burma is a country nearly shut out from the rest of the world, with the only footage of the carnage coming via groups of young, tough, booze-loving refugees who run into war zones to collect it. And with these refugees is where we find Mac McClelland embedded in her staggering debut, &lt;I&gt;For Us Surrender Is Out of the Question&lt;/I&gt;. McClelland weaves a narrative that is part investigative journalism, part popular history, and part memoir of a Midwestern, twentysomething girl living with refugee activists on the Burma-Thailand border. Driven by the community McClelland is illegally aiding&amp;#151;a small group of brave young men and women&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;For Us Surrender Is Out of the Question&lt;/I&gt; is an urgent and fascinating look at a weary conflict, told by a bright, new voice.&lt;/div&gt;" />

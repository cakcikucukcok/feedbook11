        average job seeker is frustrated with the lack of results they are getting through the traditional job hunting process of applying and waiting for
        opportunities to come to them. The common unintended consequences of waiting for opportunities are eroding self confidence, career doubt, depression
        and financial paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

        job is 9 months. This book details proven techniques, tips and actual ways for job seeker to proactively identify the job they want and land it in a
        shorter period of time. These techniques are proven and have been honed through last three recessions. In this book there are no quick-rich schemes. 
        This book examines strategic ways to define and understand what your work accomplishments are to create and understand your market value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

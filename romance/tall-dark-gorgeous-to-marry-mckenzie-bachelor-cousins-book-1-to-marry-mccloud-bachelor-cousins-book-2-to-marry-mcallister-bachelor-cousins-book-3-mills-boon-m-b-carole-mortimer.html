        &lt;p&gt;Logan McKenzie liked his life – with no surprises, and without a wife. Then he learned that Darcy, his very pretty stepsister-to-be, was in need. So he lent a hand – and his carefully controlled existence was turned upside down!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Dangerously attractive Brice McAllister has been commissioned to paint a portrait of Sabina Smith. But the elusive supermodel tries everything she can to avoid him! Brice is determined to seduce Sabina and arranges for them to be alone together…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Three terrific novels from international bestselling author.&lt;/p&gt;

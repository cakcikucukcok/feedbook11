  <title>Caught in the Line of Fire - Art Burton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing bad ever happens in Raymonds River, Nova Scotia. Its a safe, small town, where everybody knowsand trustseverybody else. When a pillar of the community is found dead in his own barnyard, people get a little concerned. When they find a bullet in his head, people get scared; who would shoot an old farmer on his own land? Understandably, even quiet, small town folk are prone to hysteria now and again.
Homicide Detective Sergeant Jim Mcdonald and Corporal Scott Bowen are called to the scene of the crime. Although they dont always work together, they make a great team when homicides the name of the game. The local law enforcement comes up with a likely suspect: a religious fanatic who claims he has God on his side. But theres no motive, which causes Mcdonald and Bowen to start asking questions.
Their questions rile up the God-fearing suspect, and soon, he wants a deal. In exchange for what he knows regarding a so-called accidental hunting death in the area, a year prior, the suspect wants to go free. He claims there was nothing accidental about it. Is their religious fool playing the crazy card, or could he really know something that might just tear the safe, small town of Raymonds River apart?" />

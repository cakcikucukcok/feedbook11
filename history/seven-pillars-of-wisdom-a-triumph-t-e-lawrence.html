Widely regarded as the last great romantic war story and described by Winston Churchill as one of &quot;the greatest books ever written in the English language,&quot; it conveys a world of wonders, written in the same committed fashion that Lawrence applied to his duties in Syria, this is a towering achievement of both autobiography and military history, as well as a first-rate adventure story. &#39;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&#39; is a must read. This edition exclusively contains over 60 maps, sketches, and other illustrations by Eric Kennington, Augustus John, William Roberts, John Singer Sargent, Frank Dobson, Colin Gill, Henry Lamb and others." />

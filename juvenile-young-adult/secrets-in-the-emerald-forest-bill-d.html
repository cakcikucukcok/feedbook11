  <title>Secrets in the Emerald Forest - Bill D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the Olympic Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, there is a giant rain forest that stretches as far as the eye can see. Rising from the woods are two mighty mountains with peaks that reach so high that they sometimes magically disappear in the clouds for days and then return with a whole new look. In the valleys there are lakes named Cushman and Upper and Lower Lena, places called Lillywamp and Potlatch. Theres even a river called the Hamma Hamma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in this beautiful and whimsical place is a family of extraordinary creatures known only to us in legendBigfoot. Two of these Bigfoot are babiesYoungersWiiLo and his little sister, LiLee. They are not only Youngers but twins, making them even more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with their older brother, Rocc, WiiLo and LiLee frolic throughout the Olympic Mountains. On their adventures they learn important lessons that every Bigfoot must know, things like how to find your way home, how to become invisible, and how to hunt for big, red, juicy apples. Join WiiLo, LiLee, and Rocc as they explore their beautiful home and learn about survival in the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Solomon&#39;s Noose - Steve Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of a young convict, Solomon Blay, who became Her Majesty&#39;s hangman in Van Diemen&#39;s Land; the man who personally had to deliver an Empire&#39;s judgment on 200 men and women, and endured his own noose of personal demons and demonisation in order to &amp;quot;survive&amp;quot;; all in the context of the great struggles of good-evil, life-death, hope-despair, which drew the attention of Darwin, Twain, Trollope and Dickens as Van Diemen&#39;s Land evolved from a Hades of Evil to sow the seeds of nationhood. The book paints a vivid picture of the society and poverty from which Blay&#39;s character was forged in England and the desperate, brutal nature of being a convict in Van Diemen&#39;s Land. Solomon&#39;s Noose is an important book in exposing the dark &#39;underbelly&#39; in the formation of modern Australia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the furthest corner of that foreign country, the past, comes the haunting story of the convict who became the British Empire&#39;s youngest executioner. Beware the shock of the true. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Andrew Rule, award-winning journalist and author. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Impressive research and a story that challenges the imagination - except that it&#39;s true. A prisoner elects to become a hangman - to improve his lot in life. All this set against the Gothic world of Van Diemen&#39;s Land in the time of convicts, bushrangers and rough justice. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Les Carlyon, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Gallipoli &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Great War&lt;/i&gt;." />

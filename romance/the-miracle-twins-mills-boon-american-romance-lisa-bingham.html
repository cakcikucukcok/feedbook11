  <title>The Miracle Twins (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Lisa Bingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Little Faith And Hope Go A Long Way&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Foreign correspondent Lucy Devon never pictured herself with kids, but when she comes across conjoined twins–baby girls–who need her help, she can&#39;t say no. The twins need the kind of medical expertise few doctors can provide, and Lucy&#39;s ex-fiance, Nick Hammond, is one of the best. The problem is, Lucy and Nick didn&#39;t exactly part on good terms–she walked out on him moments before their wedding, to chase &quot;the story of a lifetime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lucy Devon is the last person surgeon Nick Hammond expects to see on his doorstep. When she tells him her reason for being there, he knows he has to do everything he can for the girls–but the biggest complication may be his own heart. Lucy has run away from him once, and Nick feels sure that nothing short of a miracle will keep her from doing it again….&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Mystic of Karl Mind - Jürgen A.D. Graanoogst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The body is the subconscious mind that moves through different worlds where time has a different meaning. Karl Wakefield, a market merchant with no extraordinary ability, found himself in the other worlds after many moments of keeping inner secrets that urged him on. One particular question haunted him for most of his life: What if ?
A longing for understanding he willed to have a grip on reason as the past haunted him. He never expected his questions to be answered by mythical creatures, and one day he made a deal with Margus Inferian, a powerful enchanter. Karls coming was predicted, and suddenly he was pulled into a different world. He found himself witnessing abnormal events as he was hurled into a dimension where the man who knows has the answers to his unsolved mysteries and aids him to see what he could not before. He made a discovery of an ancient time, tangled in delusions of the past and hunted down by the vile figures of the Gulusis and a dark thoughts of the one in masquerade, all seeking the pendant of the mountains and the dagger of Vytos. Karl discovered powers he never knew he had.
Unwittingly, Karls wife, Eve, became involved, and he struggled between his own understanding and she who held his heart. He was forced to continue, steered by his will to where the path ahead held his future. Would they survive  or crumble and pine away for the forgotten past?" />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The bestselling priest &amp; novelist Andrew M. Greeley continues the tales of the intrepid Bishop Blackie Ryan with this absorbing &amp; suspenseful mystery, set in France, of a missing beloved television priest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just an ordinary priest but a priest/television superstar, idolized by the people of France, loved by everyone except, of course the French hierarchy, the church, state and the Paris television community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Archbishop of Paris, familiar with Bishop Blackie Ryan&#39;s impressive sleuthing skills, asks Blackie&#39;s boss, the Archbishop of Chicago Sean Cardinal Cronin, for help in finding this missing priest. As usual, Cardinal Cronin resolves the matter with a brusque &quot;See to it, Blackie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Paris, Blackie meets a young and beautiful woman begging for money at the door of the church of St-Germain-des-Prés. When he hires her as a translator, she turns out to be an excellent Dr. Watson and a brilliant musician as well. She is at his side as Blackie learns that neither the Church nor the police are eager to have the saintly priest returned, and once the public discovers the disappearance of their beloved priest, the miracles start-and nothing scares the Church more than miracles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undaunted, Blackie and his beautiful sidekick defy uncooperative Paris police, an unbending church, and reluctant witnesses to find the bizarre solution to one of the most fascinating puzzles he has ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

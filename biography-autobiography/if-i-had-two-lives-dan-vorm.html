  <title>If I Had Two Lives - Dan Vorm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pioneer missionary Costas Macris was a man who believed God for great things. Born in Greece, he moved his family to the jungles of Irian Jaya, Indonesia, where he confronted cannibalistic head-hunters, opened new mission stations, and introduced the gospel to stone-age tribes. He later returned to Greece, where he founded a bold evangelistic work where the Apostle Paul had preached some 2,000 years before. As a young man, Costas read William Carey’s famous challenge: “Attempt great things for God; expect great things from God.” Costas took these words to heart, and over a lifetime of ministry God responded in amazing ways. This inspiring account of Costas’ life will challenge you to trust God at a deeper level. You’ll be encouraged by what God did through an ordinary man who abandoned himself, without reservation, to an extraordinary God." />

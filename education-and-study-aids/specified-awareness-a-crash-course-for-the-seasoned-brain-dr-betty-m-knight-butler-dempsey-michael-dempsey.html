  <title>Specified Awareness a Crash Course for the Seasoned Brain - Dr. Betty M. Knight, Butler Dempsey, Michael Dempsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Awareness means to have knowledge or discernment of something. Since the mind is a terrible thing to waste, take this moment to integrate your memory and your imagination into your learning experience. Remember that your memory will replay your past; however, your imagination has the ability to rehearse your future. Dont reach your future and recognize that you misused the depth of your potential by not showing up for the rehearsal. 
Imagine being able to abound in an atmosphere that brings awareness of who you are as well as the benefits of the academic process. I wrote this book for men and women who returning to or just starting their academic career. However, where there is no commitment, great things will not come to pass. Commitment is the key to fulfilling your greatest dreams.
The Graduates 
As we stand with anticipation, and principles of Excellency 
Embracing our new beginning and empowered by our destinies 
Walden prepared and affirmed us on how to function in a challenge 
In areas of Leadership, Business, Communication; its a fundamental state along with talent. 
You are ready for promotion; stand steadfast in your specialties; 
Its your commitment and dedication that makes dreams, a reality. 
You could have gone to Harvard, Howard, or Stafford to gain the same results, 
However, Barker argues a paradigms shift is not in an Ivy League school. The shift begins with us. 
Our performance of what weve learned. Opportunity will present a time to shine 
Whether in Nursing, or Criminal Justice, preciseness makes others, measure the depth of your plumb line.
Strong emphasis is on the foundation that you built in all your courses 
Graduates make an impact when there are only two bad choices 
Remind yourself of the leader that you are; 
Trust your values and instincts now reset the bar 
Everything you need is in the AWARENESS in this book 
I dare you to open up any page; please take a look 
I know I have said something that can encourage you on your route 
Dont try to fit in where you are destined to stand out!" />

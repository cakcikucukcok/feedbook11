  <title>Chasing the Wanderer - Thomas Robert Gough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in the small, affluent community of Lake Tahoe at the beginning of the Trump era, Chasing the Wanderer is a coming-of-age novel about finding one&amp;rsquo;s purpose in life. It follows the lives of three millennials with no set plans for the future&amp;mdash;other than to travel the world&amp;mdash;who become entangled in a messy love triangle. It reveals the games young lovers play with each other in the digital age while at the same time examining the moral vacuum that the rise of the social media culture has created in modern day society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teddy longs to find &amp;ldquo;the one,&amp;rdquo; yet he refuses to put his heart on the line and give up his independence, while Syd tries to break down his barriers and decipher his mysteriousness with her witty charm, as she hides her romantic history from him. Maddy, a closet bi-sexual woman, tries to come to terms with her own sexuality while at the same time escaping her dark past. The three narrators waste time partying all over the world, from the Coachella Music Festival to the Cannes International Film Festival, playing games with each other&amp;rsquo;s hearts while on a mission of self-discovery and inner-awareness. Chasing the Wanderer is a poignant expose on the evolution of romance.&lt;/p&gt;" />

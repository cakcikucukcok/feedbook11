      <meta name="description" content="These are the things I&#39;ve learned and this has been my life. And so the time has come to write this little recollection. I hope you enjoy my memoir, it contains seven philosophies I&#39;ve tried to live by - I call them my &quot;realities.&quot; And it has the best, most important, lesson I learned along the way.

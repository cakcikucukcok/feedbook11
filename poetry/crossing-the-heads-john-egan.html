  <title>Crossing the Heads - John Egan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;It is a gift to take time to notice, and another to bring one&amp;rsquo;s observations into creative verse. John Egan does both with craft and conciseness. He peacefully explores his world in all its potential and limitations. It is this note of quiet, unruffled integrity that makes his poetry a pleasant reading experience. We are fortunate to have the strength of his imagery to bring our Australian urban landscapes alive. We look about us anew as a result of John&amp;rsquo;s penmanship.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Colleen Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In this new collection, John Egan demonstrates again his tender perception coupled with a poet&amp;rsquo;s sensibility and an appreciation of the contradictions of the human condition. Whether responding to his favoured urban streetscapes or to the contrasts and spectacle of the natural world, John brings his trademark use of simile, and the inspiration of an educator, to craft fine and evocative poems. A joy for the reader.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; David Atkinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;John Egan is a poet of brilliant images. We gasp with delighted recognition when he takes us to a familiar landscape, and know it more deeply because, by giving us words we could not have found for ourselves, he shows us the way to a new experience.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Robin Hillard, &lt;em&gt;Polestar Writers Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

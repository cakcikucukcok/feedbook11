  <title>Born Again - Tom Harpur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The search for meaning in our time of change and upheaval continues unabated. Tom Harpur, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Pagan Christ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Water Into Wine&lt;/i&gt;, has been at the forefront of this modern challenge to humankind’s spiritual identity. His radical and ground-breaking book &lt;i&gt;The Pagan Christ&lt;/i&gt; touched the lives of thousands of seekers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Born Again: My Journey from Fundamentalism to Freedom&lt;/i&gt; he tells us the story of his own search and the result is a compelling spiritual odyssey, the story of one man’s escape from the narrow grip of religious fundamentalism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born into an Irish immigrant family in Toronto, Tom Harpur was groomed for the ministry by his father from an early age. He won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, then returned to Canada and enrolled in Wycliffe College, the bastion of Anglican evangelicalism. Ordained to the ministry, Tom Harpur served for a number of years in his own parish before seeking a wider ministry in the world of mass media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Tom Harpur joined the Toronto Star as the religion editor and over a number of years reported on and met many important figures from Pope John Paul and Mother Teresa to the Dali Lama, Jean Vanier, and Billy Graham. Here are fascinating anecdotes about these influential people and compelling accounts of the author’s travels around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Tom Harpur’s most intimate book, &lt;i&gt;Born Again&lt;/i&gt; is a important work of spiritual insight, revelation and renewal.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Eat My Schwartz - Geoff Schwartz, Mitch Schwartz, Seth Kaufman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Geoff and Mitchell Schwartz are the NFL&#39;s most improbable pair of offensive linemen. They started their football careers late, not playing a down of organized football until they joined their low-key high school program. Despite all that, they wound up at top-tier college programs and became the first Jewish brothers in the league since 1923.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Eat My Schwartz&lt;/i&gt;, Geoff and Mitch talk about the things that have made them the extraordinary people that they are: their close-knit and supportive family, their Jewish faith and traditions, their love of the game and drive for excellence and, last but not least, the food they love to eat, whether at home or on the road. Theirs is an inspiring story not just for every football fan but for everybody wanting to figure out what it takes for dreams to come true--and how to stay well-fed throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />

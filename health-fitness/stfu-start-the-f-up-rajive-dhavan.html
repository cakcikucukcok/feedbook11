The ecosystem is bustling with ideas, pitches, funding, and more. Start-ups have suddenly become a rage all over. Serial entrepreneur and author Rajive Dhavan is among those risk-takers who entered the start-up world at the age of 22, with as little as Rs. 40,000. All he had was an idea that he believed in. During his journey, he challenged the status quo, witnessed success, embraced failure and showcased exponential growth. Incidentally, Dhavan has founded three separate companies so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In STFUStart The F Up, he shares some basic ideologies he developed through the initial phase as an entrepreneur. Dhavan has drawn his perspective from the fundamentals of business and management, self-belief, and real-world experiences and failures. Geared toward present and future leaders of start-ups and small and medium-sized companies, he offers a new way of looking at things with an honest, unusual and a broader perspectivea perspective that has lived deep inside you but hasnt come to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Living Aboard a Boat Named Farfetched - Ron Arbizzani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of one couples adventures living and traveling aboard their 47-foot cruiser, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Farfetched&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.  It starts with their getting hooked on boating and traveling by water, many years earlier.  It tells how they made their decision to really make this move and of their search for the right boat.&lt;br&gt;
In 1997 they sold their home and all of their possessions to became full time live aboard boaters. During that eight-year odyssey, they traveled over 32,000 miles and visited every major city in the eastern U S.  They got to cities teeming with activity and to isolated anchorages where no one else was within miles. &lt;br&gt;                                  
They experienced the serenity, beauty and solitude of anchorages in crystal clear waters off deserted beaches in the Exhuma Islands.  There were also the spectacular sunsets as they made overnight passages across the Gulf of Mexico and cruised the North Channel of Lake Huron in Canada.&lt;br&gt;
It also tells of the anxiety they experienced when running in high seas or looking for unseen shoals.  There was also the sudden panic as they went aground and struggled to get free again.  They encountered seven hurricanes in those eight years and tell how they had to deal with them." />

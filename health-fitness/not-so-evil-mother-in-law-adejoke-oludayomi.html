  <title>Not so Evil Mother in Law - Adejoke Oludayomi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mother in Law! 
The very mention of that word is enough to send shivers down the spine of the newly wedded bride or groom. The widespread view is that mothers in law are out to make the marriage as hot and as rocky as possible.
And to be candid, some mothers have decided to do just that.
But does it have to be so? Cant we be a mother in law with a difference? 
Im sure we can. It may not come naturally for some. So we just have to learn how.
Using the Biblical story of Ruth and Naomi along with fictional and non-fictional examples, Not So Evil Mother in Law takes you along the not too difficult route of learning how to be a near perfect mother in law.
That new member of your family could actually be a treasure to you.
You only need to dig deep to find it." />

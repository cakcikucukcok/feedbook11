  <title>How to Get There from Here...The Ten Lessons That Have Served Me Well - Coleman H. Ronald D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THEN AND NOW
In 1971, as an undergraduate student at Loyola University of Chicago, I often sat on the steps of the Chicago Water Tower during class breaks. I watched the traffic flowing north and south along Michigan Avenues bustling Magnificent Mile. As a kid who hailed from the housing projects on the west side of Chicago, I marveled at the late model cars, beautifully tailored pedestrians and the expensive boutiques that lined the street.
I often wondered, How do you get there from here?
In 1994, I arrived in Bentonville, Arkansas to assume my new post as the Senior Vice-President of the People Division for Wal-Mart Stores (Sam Waltons term for human resources). Soon to become the worlds largest retailer and private employer, a Fortune #1 company and among the Fortune 100 Best Companies To Work For. I had experienced an exciting and satisfying journey.
Today, residing on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina I enjoy my role as consultant and corporate board member for several public companies. Over the years, I have shared my thoughts on getting there from here in many places around the world. Why not finally put them in a book? Good question. This book is my answer. Enjoy." />

  <title>The Reluctant General - Herb Sennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of Deborah and Barak from the biblical book of Judges describes amazing courage and fortitude beyond modern comprehension. In this retelling of the old story, Herb Sennett brings to life the people of 1150 BC in such a way that their hopes, dreams, struggles, pain, and suffering help us face our own problems in the light of Gods willingness to help his people whenever they are threatened with extinction. He describes Deborah as a woman who goes against tradition and leads an army into battle by convincing a highly respected farmer known as Barak that with God all things are possible. The Jewish people of that day knew little of warfare and tactics, but they were able to defeat the most powerful army of the day and then conquer the most heavily defended city in the area. This novel tells of their struggle to live free of oppression and fear through their faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;" />

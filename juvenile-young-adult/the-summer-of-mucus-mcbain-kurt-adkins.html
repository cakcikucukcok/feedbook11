  <title>The Summer of Mucus Mcbain - Kurt Adkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fifth grader Marcus Mucus McBain and his best friends, Walter, Sam, and Tex, always find a way to have fun. Whether searching for a misplaced, expensive baseball card, being forced to attend manners class, or playing for one of the worst baseball teams in Little League history, it is no secret that the fabulous foursome relies on orneriness, imagination, and a whole lot of determination to seek out adventure in their California town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the boys progress through fifth grade, they share many laughter-filled moments, usually at the expense of their nemesis, high school football player Bart Broznan, who happens to be the boyfriend of Mucus older sister. During the school year and the summer that follows, the group sets out on one hilarious adventure after another, often landing in hot water with teachers, camp counselors, and other adults. It is definitely shaping up to be a boys-will-be-boys summer until tragedy strikes and forces all of them to examine their friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this entertaining childrens story, four adventurous boys embark on a roller-coaster journey through fifth grade and beyond, eventually making it a summer to remember.&lt;/p&gt;" />

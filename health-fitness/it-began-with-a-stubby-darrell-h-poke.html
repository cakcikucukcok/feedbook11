  <title>It Began with a Stubby - Darrell H. Poke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Darrell Poke was a self-described dyed-in the-wool atheist raised in a working-class family with a limited educational background, working the rough-and-tumble mines of Australia. Although he might seem like an unlikely source for spiritual development, in this guide he brings you inside his own unexpected journey to true spiritual awakeningas only an Aussie can!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The very concept of God was not a part of his upbringing. His teachers and peers considered him to be a daydreamer who wouldnt amount to much, and Darrell is the first to admit he used to prove them rightuntil something happened that opened his eyes and heart to a broader view of the world.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He stumbled his way into spirituality and started to explore the idea that God or a higher self might actually exist. What hes come to realize is that God does existand we are it. We are all a piece of God. He, She, or It is within each of us and is there to give us everything we ever need, regardless of our beliefs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For Darrell, life is an amazing and surprisingly simple journey. In It Began with a Stubby, he takes all that he has studied and presents it in clear, everyday language so that others may easily share his epiphany. Open your eyes, open your heart, and a new reality  awaits.&lt;/P&gt;" />

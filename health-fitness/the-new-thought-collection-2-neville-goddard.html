  <title>The New Thought Collection #2 - Neville Goddard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the second volume in our New Thought Movement series. The New Thought Movement paved the way for the modern prosperity movement. It was the New Thought writers who first brought attention to the concept of manifesting wealth, right thinking, and the power of positive thinking. Without their landmark works many of today&#39;s best selling prosperity books could not have been written. Now, together for the first time, are ten of the most important books ever written on the subject of Wealth and Success by the best New Thought writers. We&#39;ve gathered another 1,000+ pages of the best advice and instruction that you&#39;ll ever receive on how to become successful, for one incredibly reasonable price. The writers in this volume are all legendary and for good reason. It&#39;s time to stop hoping for success and do something about getting it. This book will guide you every step of the way. Collected in this omnibus edition are &#39;The Science of Being Great&#39; by Wallace D. Wattles; &#39;The Master Key to This Mystical Life of Ours&#39; by Ralph Waldo Trine; &#39;The Law of Success: In Sixteen Lessons&#39; by Napoleon Hill; &#39;Your Word Is Your Wand&#39; by Florence Scovel Shinn; &#39;The Power of Concentration&#39; by Theron Q. Dumont; &#39;Dynamic Laws of Prosperity&#39; by Catherine Ponder; &#39;Thoughts are Things&#39; by Prentice Mulford; &#39;The Secret of the Ages&#39; by Robert Collier; &#39;Thought Vibration, or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World&#39; by William Walker Atkinson; and &#39;The Law and Other Essays on Manifestation&#39; by Neville Goddard." />

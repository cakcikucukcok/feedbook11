  <title>Saving the American Dream - Louis Hernandez Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Saving the American Dream is a provocative and thoughtful account of how our nations ideals of equality and the pursuit of happiness emerged as an inspiration and a beacon of hope for the entire world, and how politicians, Wall Street and our own sense of entitlement have gradually eroded this Dream to the point of endangering Americas preeminence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fascinating and informative book, Louis Hernandez, Jr. explores the origins, evolution and economic underpinnings of the American Dream, detailing how key government policies over-facilitated the Dreams attainment, weakened the will of the American people and drove us inexorably toward the 2007 financial crisis. He shows how policies put in place after the crisis not only failed to address the core problems America faces, but created a growing disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street that has made things far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book examines how our myopic political focus on Too Big to Fail institutions has threatened the most crucial pillars of the American Dream  our small businesses, and the community banks and credit unions that support them  and sabotaged their ability to support job growth and responsible financial services for families and local communities.&lt;/p&gt;" />

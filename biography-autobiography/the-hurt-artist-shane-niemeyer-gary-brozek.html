  <title>The Hurt Artist - Shane Niemeyer, Gary Brozek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With troubles beginning as early as childhood, the trajectory of Shane Niemeyer&#39;s life seemed to have only one direction: down. His struggles with heroin addiction led him to jail, and he eventually hit rock bottom. Soon, his two pack a day cigarette habit was the healthiest thing he did. One dark night in jail, his suicide attempt failed. What happened next transcends the term recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hurt Artist&lt;/i&gt; is the searing yet luminous travelogue of Shane&#39;s powerful journey from suicidal addict to Ironman. He vividly depicts the landscape of pain in which he&#39;s lived his life--emotional and physical pain inflicted upon him and that he inflicts upon himself, pain that pulls him down, and, in detailing his training, the pain he harnesses to lift himself up. Ultimately, Shane&#39;s story is one of redemption and triumph, a lesson in the value of second chances and a clear reminder that nobody, regardless of how seemingly desperate their circumstances, is beyond the reach of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From inmate #71768 to Ironman Triathlon World Championship competitor #1419, Shane paints a stirring self-portrait in this hilarious, horrifying, and hopeful account that is sure to hook readers of edgy sports biographies.&lt;/p&gt;" />

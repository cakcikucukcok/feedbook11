  <title>Birdie - Tracey Lindberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monkey Beach&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Green Grass, Running Water&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;The Beachcombers&lt;/em&gt; in this wise and funny novel by a debut Cree author&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birdie&lt;/em&gt; is a darkly comic and moving first novel about the universal experience of recovering from wounds of the past, informed by the lore and knowledge of Cree traditions. Bernice Meetoos, a Cree woman, leaves her home in Northern Alberta following tragedy and travels to Gibsons, BC. She is on something of a vision quest, seeking to understand the messages from &lt;em&gt;The Frugal Gourmet&lt;/em&gt; (one of the only television shows available on CBC North) that come to her in her dreams. She is also driven by the leftover teenaged desire to meet Pat Johns, who played Jesse on &lt;em&gt;The Beachcombers&lt;/em&gt;, because he is, as she says, a working, healthy Indian man. Bernice heads for Molly’s Reach to find answers but they are not the ones she expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the arrival in Gibsons of her Auntie Val and her cousin Skinny Freda, Bernice finds the strength to face the past and draw the lessons from her dreams that she was never fully taught in life. Part road trip, dream quest and travelogue, the novel touches on the universality of women&#39;s experience, regardless of culture or race.&lt;/p&gt;" />

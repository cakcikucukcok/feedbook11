  <title>Men In the Labour Room: Men&#39;s Guide to the Delivery Room Experience - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The pending arrival of a baby is a wonderful time! It doesn&#39;t matter what the circumstances, when a new baby comes into the world, it is a true miracle. As is expected, much of the focus in the delivery room is on the woman. After all, she is the one who is enduring the pain of childbirth. What many people don&#39;t consider is that the men in the delivery room have their own issues as well.  Years ago, men weren&#39;t allowed in the delivery room. Men were relegated to the waiting room, left to pace a hole in the floor as they waited for their offspring to be born. Today, however, there has been an enormous shift in tradition, with 90 per cent of dads now taking a hands-on approach in the birthing process.  In eBook, you&#39;ll be better prepared to help with back labour, understanding what happens in the birthing room, easing the pain of mom, and dealing with your own feelings of helplessness. It can be a daunting and scary experience, but you CAN get through it - just like SHE can!  Read on, and be guided." />

  <title>What Is Your Name? - Frankie L. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frankie L. Jackson, in his many years of service in the kingdom of God, has devoted his life in search of the true message of the Gospel. A message overshadowed by religion and, to some extent, misunderstood by both Christians and non-Christians. In this book, What Is Your Name? Pastor Jackson brings to light the theme and focus of Christs message and why He came to die for the world. He strongly believes that the impact of the Gospel is closely related to our presentation of the message Christ preached. 
You will be encouraged to reexamine your life as you take a closer look at where you fit in the plan of God. Who am I to God? and how does He see me? These questions can easily be answered once youve discovered your heavenly name.

-Why Names Are Important to God

-What Is Your Heavenly Name
-Satan: The Enemy of Your Name
-Living Up to Your Name
Discovering your heavenly name can add meaning to your life and give you value beyond your earthly name. God wanted to give you more than dominion; He wanted you to have His image and likeness and a heavenly name." />

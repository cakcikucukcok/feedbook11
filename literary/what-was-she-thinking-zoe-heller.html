  <title>What Was She Thinking? - Zoe Heller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lonely schoolteacher reveals more than she intends when she records the story of her best friend&#39;s affair with a pupil in this sly, insightful novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schoolteacher Barbara Covett has led a solitary existence; aside from her cat, Portia, she has few friends and no intimates. When Sheba Hart joins St. George&#39;s as the new art teacher, Barbara senses the possibility of a new friendship. It begins with lunches and continues with regular invitations to meals with Sheba&#39;s seemingly close-knit family. But as Barbara and Sheba&#39;s relationship develops, another does as well: Sheba has begun a passionate affair with an underage male student. When it comes to light and Sheba falls prey to the inevitable media circus, Barbara decides to write an account in her friend&#39;s defense--an account that reveals not only Sheba&#39;s secrets but her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Was She Thinking?&lt;/i&gt; is a story of repression and passion, envy and complacence, friendship and loneliness. A complex psychological portrait framed as a wicked satire, it is by turns funny, poignant, and sinister. With it, Zoë Heller surpasses the promise of her critically acclaimed first novel, &lt;i&gt;Everything You Know.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Was She Thinking?&lt;/i&gt; is the basis of the 2006 film, Notes on a Scandal, starring Judi Dench and Kate Blanchett.&lt;/p&gt;" />

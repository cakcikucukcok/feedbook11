  <title>Caged Heroes - Jon Couch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Caged Heroes - American POW Experiences from the American Revolution to the Present is snapshot of four hundred years of hostage and prisoner of war experiences. Caged Heroes details prisoners experiences from the moment they are told to put their hands up, through their detentions, and culminating in their releases. It examines the successes and failures of the United States government to prepare its forces for prisoner events; discussing survival schools, rules on how prisoners are told to act while in captivity and glimpses of how being taken prisoner effects the prisoners and guards alike. Using numerous personal interviews and diaries of former prisoners (and their spouses), the reader gets a rare look at the horrors these men and women experienced. Containing an extensive bibliography and complete POW rosters from several conflicts, this book will add to any casual readers knowledge and serve as a top reference for those wanting to understand more about this misunderstood field.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Dirty Politics, Dirty Times - Michael Ashcroft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a newly revised and updated paperback edition of the former Conservative Party Treasurer&#39;s personal account of his battle over unsubstantiated claims concerning his business affairs which culminated in a libel action against &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. The book reveals the dirty tricks that were used to destabilise the Conservative Party, including the newspaper&#39;s alleged bribery of US government officials, and the abuse of parliamentary privileges by New Labour MPs. This is Lord Ashcroft&#39;s compelling account of the attacks on his reputation by New Labour spin-doctors out to slander the Conservative Party and journalists seeking to create a story. This new edition also sheds new light on Michael Ashcroft&#39;s private life; his childhood and love of Belize, his business career and his many and varied interests." />

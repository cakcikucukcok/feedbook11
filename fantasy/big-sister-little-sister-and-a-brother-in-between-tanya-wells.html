  <title>Big Sister, Little Sister, and a Brother in Between - Tanya Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I look back on my life, I realize its not what I have in life but who I have in my life that matters. There
will always be people that matter the most to me. And those people are my family. How lucky am I to have people
that love and support me, people that are and have made amazing memories with me. Its the people in my life who
want me in theirs, the ones who accept me for who I am, the ones who do not judge, and the ones who loved me
then, love me still, love me now, and always will. They are the ones who would do anything for me just to see me
smile and who love me no matter what. Having somewhere to go is home. Having someone to love is family. Having
both is a blessing. God truly blessed me with a loving mother and father and eight siblings, which became my chosen
family. We were founded by faith, joined by love, kept by God together forever. Blessed is the family who hears the
Word of the Lord and obeys it (Luke 11:28).
Familywhere life begins and love never ends. Where prayer is powerful and secrets are shared. Where parents
believe too much love never spoils a child. Where there are no friendships better than that of sisters and brothers.
In this book, Big Sister, Little Sister, and A brother In Between, two sisters and one brother face an awesomely
unique and difficult challenge of moving from the city to a country dairy farm. Not knowing what to expect and all
the effects of the big move put the siblings at odds with one another. The standards and rules their parents created
will make you believe in second chances, blessings, and love. It is how they learn to live as a family where truth never
loses, where love is unconditional, and where two parents see imperfect people perfectly.
Family are the people who make you hungry for life, touch your heart, and nourish your soul (unknown).
Wings are to show you what you can become. Roots are to remind you where youre from (unknown).
The family is the center of life and it is the key to eternal happiness (L. Tom Perry)." />

He&#39;s not the only man out of work, but his past as a former heavyweight contender with a few shady connections-not to mention the color of his skin in race-obsessed New Orleans-isn&#39;t helping lure clients to his door. Stuck without any viable alternative, he takes a case from an old criminal acquaintance, Storm. His only client assures him that the job is simple-locate his missing estranged daughter, Zelda, no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Fletcher starts knocking on doors, he sets off a catastrophic chain of events that turn the city into a bloody battleground between two rival syndicates. Then Storm is murdered and Fletcher finds himself caught between the police and dangerous mobsters. With Zelda&#39;s safety in the balance, the unlikely private detective finds himself with a lot more than he bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Red Storm&lt;/i&gt; is the first novel from licensed private investigator-turned-novelist Grant Bywaters.&lt;/p&gt;" />

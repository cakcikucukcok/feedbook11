  <title>Birthday Dance - Peter Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author comes a riveting collection of short fiction, marked by the piercing psychological insight and brilliant characterization that are hallmarks of his acclaimed novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the publication of his first mystery featuring Detective Inspector Alan Banks, Peter Robinson has been steadily building a reputation for compulsively readable and perceptive novels that probe the dark side of human nature. Plumbing the territory that he has so successfully staked, &lt;em&gt;The Price of Love and Other Stories&lt;/em&gt; includes two novellas and several stories featuring the Yorkshire policeman at his finest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the novella &amp;#8220;Going Back,&amp;#8221; never before published in the United States, Banks returns home for a family reunion, only to find it taking a decidedly sinister turn. In &amp;#8220;Like a Virgin,&amp;#8221; written especially for this volume, Banks revisits the period in his life and the terrible crime that led him to leave London for Eastvale. And in between, the disparate motives that move us to harm one another, from love and jealousy to greed and despair, are all explored with fascinating depth.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Spellbinder - Helen Stringer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Belladonna Johnson can see ghosts. It&#39;s a trait she&#39;s inherited from her mother&#39;s side of the family, like blue eyes or straight hair. And it&#39;s a trait she could do without, because what twelve-year-old wants to be caught talking to someone invisible? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is convenient, though, after Belladonna&#39;s parents are killed in a car accident. They can live with her the same as always, watching the same old TV shows in their same old house. Nothing has changed . . . until &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, with no warning, they vanish into thin air--along with every other ghost in the world. It&#39;s what some people think ghosts are supposed to do, but Belladonna knows it&#39;s all wrong. They may not be living, but they&#39;re not supposed to be gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of her classmate Steve, a master of sneaking and spying, Belladonna is left to uncover what&#39;s become of the spirits and to navigate a whole world her parents have kept well-hidden. If she can&#39;t find her way, she&#39;ll lose them again--this time for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />

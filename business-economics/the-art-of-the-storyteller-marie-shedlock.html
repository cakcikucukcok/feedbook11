  <title>The Art of the StoryTeller - Marie Shedlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can You Keep Your Readers Riveted by Your Storytelling?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some years ago I heard Miss Shedlock tell stories in England. Her fine sense of literary and dramatic values, her power in sympathetic interpretation, always restrained within the limits of the art she was using, and her understanding of educational values, based on a wide experience of teaching, all marked her as an artist in story-telling. She was equally at home in interpreting the subtle blending of wit and wisdom in Daudet, the folk lore philosophy of Grimm, or the deeper world philosophy and poignant human appeal of Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then she came to America and for two or three years she taught us the difference between the nightingale that sings in the tree tops and the artificial bird that goes with a spring. Cities like New York, Boston, Pittsburgh and Chicago listened and heard, if sometimes indistinctly, the notes of universal appeal, and children saw the Arabian Nights come true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yielding to the appeals of her friends in America and England, Miss Shedlock has put together in this little book such observations and suggestions on story-telling as can be put in words. Those who have the artist&amp;#39;s spirit will find their sense of values quickened by her words, and they will be led to escape some of the errors into which even the greatest artists fall. And even those who tell stories with their minds will find in these papers wise generalizations and suggestions born of wide experience and extended study which well go far towards making even an artificial nightingale&amp;#39;s song less mechanical. To those who know, the book is a revelation of the intimate relation between a child&amp;#39;s instincts and the finished art of dramatic presentation. To those who do not know it will bring echoes of reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(from the Preface)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This classic is now republished for modern writers and storytellers to perfect their craft. The goal is riveted readers that want to buy your next book and the one after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The degree you can tell a story and breathe life into its characters will measure your success as a storyteller and so, an author.&lt;br /&gt;

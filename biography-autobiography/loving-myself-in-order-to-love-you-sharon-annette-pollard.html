  <title>Loving Myself in Order to Love You - Sharon Annette Pollard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many episodes of my life made me believe that I had actually found this unique and special love, but as before, it was an illusion.  This love I wished for would be a love that I had never experience before. And I often wondered...&quot;does this love even exist? And God answered that question for me and that answer was yes. It does exist, but it must start with me.  In so many cases we as women are the ones that give our love so freely, so openly, and so honestly. But in return we accept the negativity of a relationship. We accept the name calling, the abuse whether its verbal or physical by the ones we have given our all. This is not the love that God has blessed us with, but the behavior that we have accepted and think it is love. Life is a lesson learned daily. The ups and the downs of relationships that we think are based on love are only stepping stones to a better understanding about love and how it is given and how it is accepted.  But, first take a look in the mirror and admire the reflection you see looking back at you. Love her, respect her, and admire her beauty, her uniqueness. She is rare, one of a kind. There is no one like her and her values are beyond any wealth. It is only then when you began to love that person, and accept that person, you will learn what this unspeakable love is all about and how to receive and to give it without doubt." />

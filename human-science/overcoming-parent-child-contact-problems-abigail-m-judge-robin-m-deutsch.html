  <title>Overcoming Parent-Child Contact Problems - Abigail M. Judge, Robin M. Deutsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In recent years there has been heightened interest in the clinical and legal management of families in which children resist contact with one parent and become aligned with the other following divorce. Families affected by these dynamics require disproportionate resources and time from mental health and legal professionals, and cases require a specialized clinical approach. Traditional models of individual and family therapy are not designed to address these issues, and strategies and resources for mental health and legal professionals have been extremely limited.
&lt;em&gt;Overcoming Parent-Child Contact Problems&lt;/em&gt; describes interventions for families experiencing a high conflict divorce impasse where a child is resisting contact with a parent. It examines in detail one such intervention, the Overcoming Barriers approach, involving the entire family and combining psycho-education and clinical intervention. The book is divided into two parts: Part I presents an overview of parental alienation, including clinical approaches and a critical analysis of the many challenges associated with traditional outpatient family-based interventions. Part II presents the Overcoming Barriers approach, describing core aspects of the intervention and ways to adapt its clinical techniques to outpatient practice. &lt;em&gt;Overcoming Parent-Child Contact Problems&lt;/em&gt; is geared toward mental health clinicians and legal professionals who work with families in high conflict and where a child resists visitation with a parent." />

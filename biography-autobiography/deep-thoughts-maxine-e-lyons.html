  <title>Deep Thoughts - Maxine E. Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a student in school, I have always liked writing essays and stories. However, it was not until 1996 that the urge to write poetry came over me, an urge that I could not resist. It was then I penned my first piece called Life.
&lt;p&gt;
Deep Thoughts became my brain child in 2001 when I wrote Double Towers a very prominent work, about the destruction of the World Trade Center. This work was so accepted, giving birth to this brain Child has finally become a reality.
&lt;p&gt;
Deep Thoughts depicts a lot of my life experiences and the every day happenings. Some of its pieces also portrays a synopsis of public and private figures alike.
&lt;p&gt;
Compiling this anthology did not take the form of sitting at a computer for hours and write, instead, most of the poems were writing in the most unusual places. Some of my favorite writing venues were: restaurants, laundry mats, clubs, parks, the bus, the train and strange, but true, the shower.
&lt;p&gt;
We live poetry in our every day lives, therefore, its not just words written on a piece of paper or in a book; it is the reality of existence.
&lt;p&gt;
DEEP THOUGHTS gives you that reality.

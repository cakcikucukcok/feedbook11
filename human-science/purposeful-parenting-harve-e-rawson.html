  <title>Purposeful Parenting - Harve E. Rawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=justify&gt;
At last!  A guide to parenting that actually talks about the art of 
parenting.  This book, in plain language, tackles many of the 
problems today&#39;s parents experience AND gives you practical, 
realistic ways of effectively dealing with them. Written by a 
child psychologist with a lifetime of experience, the book pulls 
no punches and focuses on what works and what doesn&#39;t. 
&lt;p align=justify&gt;
The book is organized around thirty-two pertinent topics that 
most concern parents today.  Some sample topics are: &quot;Help! I&#39;m 
a Single Parent,&quot; &quot;Your Child and Sports,&quot; &quot;Help! My Kid&#39;s 
Getting Fat!&quot; &quot;Helping Your Child Do His Best in School,&quot; &quot;Sex 
and the American Teenager - What&#39;s a Parent to Do?,&quot; &quot;Religion 
in a Child&#39;s Life,&quot; &quot;Divorce and Kids - What Really Happens,&quot; 
&quot;Is TV All Bad?&quot; &quot;Teaching Your Child Morality,&quot; &quot;Helping 
Your Kids Pull Themselves Out of Bad Social Situations,&quot; and 
&quot;Red Flags for Parents!&quot;  All thirty-two topics were generated by 
parents themselves, calling in their requests for topics to a radio 
show on parenting hosted by the author of this book. 
&lt;p align=justify&gt;
The author, Dr. Harve E. Rawson, has a lot to say.  He has been 
a professor of psychology for thirty-two years, a dean of faculty, 
a research scientist, director of a residential program for children 
with behavior problems for twenty-five years, producer of two 
syndicated radio shows, author of 40 professional journal articles 
regarding work with children, and author of four books. His 
professional knowledge of child psychology, clinical social 
work, and all aspects of education, plus the practical experience 
of rearing two sons, reflects itself in every page of this book 
which he describes as &quot;the culmination of everything that I, or 
anyone I&#39;ve ever read or talked to, know about parenting.&quot;" />

Copies of the original Japanese edition have been jealously coveted by knitters around the world&amp;#8212;and now the book is now being made available in English for the first time! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hitomi Shida&#39;s previous work, the &lt;i&gt;Japanese Knitting Stitch Bible&lt;/i&gt; was released by Tuttle in October 2017 and has already been purchased by thousands of avid knitters who are thrilled to discover a treasure trove of elegant and intricate new patterns. This book was Hitomi Shida&#39;s first effort and, like its successor is filled with her highly original and beautiful designs and variations on knitting classics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shida&#39;s stitch patterns have become a driving inspiration behind many modern Western knitting designs, and experienced knitters know this.

  <title>Dusk - Jervis T.C.H.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 2415 as Dusk Cooper, a thirteen-year-old half-human and half-Scentellian, happily explores the beautiful planet of Amiros with his two best friends, Keegan and Raven. But when an explosion suddenly rocks their spaceship, the crew has no choice but to crash-land on the nearest island. Moments later, the three crawl out of the disabled ship to find they are sharing the island with ravenous creatures.
After the crew radios for help, they are told to head to the highest point on the island to wait for rescue ships. But first, they must battle the ferocious plant-like creatures determined to stand in their way. As an epic battle rages, the crew soon runs out of ammo, leaving Dusk to brainstorm an alternative solution. With the help of Ravens PDA, he transforms himself into a fire-breathing dragon who, with Raven and Keegan riding on his back, must fight his way through the creatures to what he hopes will be an eventual rescue. But just when he thinks things are on the upswing, the PDAs batteries begin to run out. Unfortunately, it is just the beginning of their challenges.
In this exciting tale, three explorers in a futuristic world must do everything in their power to escape the island of death, before it is too late for all of them." />

  <title>The Respectful Parent - James A. Deutch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most important job you will ever have is being a parent. Parents usually
raise their children the way they were parented, no matter how good or bad
their experience. People laugh when they say, Babies dont come with an
instruction manual. The Respectful Parent: A Manual for Moms and Dads
may be the closest book to that much needed manual. This book is for parents
whose normal children are driving them up the wall, and parents who want to
improve their parenting skills while things are still going well.
The Respectful Parent is written in a personal style by an author, who has
over 55 years of clinical experience working with families and individuals of all
ages. Dr. Deutch believes that respect between parent and child, along with a
toolbox of great common sense techniques, is the key to having a cooperative,
happy and productive family. Spanking, yelling, and threats may work on your
child in the immediate situation, but scientific research shows that in the long
term, they have many negative and sometimes catastrophic side effects. The
Respectful Parent teaches how to use positive and democratic ways to nurture
children. These ideas are based on the commonsensical philosophy of Doctors
Alfred Adler and Rudolph Dreikurs.
Learn to use the power of encouragement, the family council, individual special
time, natural and logical consequences, and simple communication techniques. Become
your childs consultant rather than boss. Raise your childs self-esteem, courage,
mental health, and even his or her I.Q." />

  <title>Becoming Buster&#39;s Bitch - K.W. Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When Diane Chamberlain initially decided to spend her two-week summer vacation with her sister in Regal Bay, she had no idea that over those two weeks she would be transformed from a conservative and ethical woman into a sexual degenerate, craving the carnal satisfaction only a canine could provide her. Over the course of two weeks, Diane would submit to ever deepening depravity as she is introduced to bestiality by her loving miscreant sister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With her heart suddenly thudding hard in her chest, Diane went to her bed and sat on the end. Buster lay his head on her thigh, his big brown eyes looking up at hers, his tail wagging excitedly. She could still feel the afterglow of too many alcoholic drinks consumed that evening as she stroked his ears back and down his muscular neck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You hungry for some pussy, big guy?&amp;rdquo; she finally asked. Diane stroked his head a few more times, trying hard to change her mind, and getting nowhere. She was as horny as she&amp;rsquo;d ever been and needed to get off. And after what Buster had done for her that afternoon, Diane felt the craving deep in her core.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is this what you&amp;rsquo;re hungry for, Buster?&amp;rdquo; she asked. She wiggled her knees slowly, opening and closing her thighs, until she couldn&amp;rsquo;t take the anticipation any more. &amp;ldquo;Come and get it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether Buster understood or not, when she opened her thighs as wide as they would go, he leaped up onto the end of the bed, his forepaws on the mattress between her thighs and his hot breath against her crotch. Immediately, Buster&amp;rsquo;s long tongue flashed out to smack against Diane&amp;rsquo;s pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh!&amp;rdquo; she yelped. Her body jolted at the contact, and again as Buster began to lap away happily, licking her juices up, which had begun to flow at first contact. She let her head roll back and sighed, &amp;ldquo;Goddamnit! That feels so fucking good!&amp;rdquo; Diane had to admit, what her sister had said was a fact. Once she&amp;rsquo;s enjoyed a dog&amp;rsquo;s tongue against her pussy, there was no comparison." />

&lt;p&gt;
Nope! What you are holding in your hands may very well change the course of your entire life.
&lt;p&gt;
(Yeah, you heard me!)
&lt;p&gt;
In fact, it has already changed this person&#39;s life! (By the way, in case you&#39;re wondering, this person was not paid to say this) &quot;When it comes to the opposite sex, I have always been worried about rejection, awkwardness, and commitment ... That is until I stumbled upon Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly. What a godsend! The practical advice and seasoned wisdom I gleamed gave me just what I needed, the courage to ask the girl I liked out (and we&#39;re still together by the way). My life will never be the same!
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you so much! I still can&#39;t believe that I now actually have a girlfriend! Amazing!&quot;

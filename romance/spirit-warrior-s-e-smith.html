  <title>Spirit Warrior - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Allie Whitewater is used to living between two worlds, embracing both the Native American heritage of her father and the white heritage of her mother. She is happy with both and didn&amp;rsquo;t have the identity crisis many of her friends had growing up. She loves every aspect of the life on a working ranch that her twin left behind, and has no desire to live in town, or worse, a large city. No, Allie planned to spend the rest of her life on the ranch her father started, running it and making it even better than ever &amp;ndash; and then she decided to help her best friend and sister of the heart, Indiana, return to her new home&amp;hellip;which turned out to be in the &amp;lsquo;wild west&amp;rsquo; of 1867.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob Tucker enjoys building up the ranch that he and his twin brother, Jonathan, settled. Sure, there are dangers &amp;ndash; rustlers, the harsh environment, Indians &amp;ndash; but he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trade it for anything in the world, or so he thought. When he helps rescue his brother&amp;rsquo;s new bride, Indiana, his idea of what life is changes, because Indy has been taken back to her world &amp;ndash; in 2013, and in order to save her, they have to follow. Everything sure changed a lot in 146 years, including the women, but one woman in particular has branded her name on his heart &amp;ndash; Allie Whitewater. She has the mouth of a cowpuncher, the body of an angel, and the temper of the Devil himself. Once Indy is safe, all he has to do is get Allie back to his time and hold her so tight she won&amp;rsquo;t miss her fancy metal wagons and flying carriages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob thinks his plan is foolproof, but history won&amp;rsquo;t stand still for two souls born in different eras. How can he hope to keep Allie safe when the whites see her as a red-skin savage and the Indians don&amp;rsquo;t know what to think of her?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When cultures clash, it will be up to Allie to show she is capable of walking in both worlds &amp;ndash; and that no matter who she is dealing with, she is a force to be reckoned with. Can the past handle a modern woman&amp;rsquo;s view or will it destroy the very thing that makes her the perfect partner for a man of the past: her warrior spirit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of romance and adventure. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid scenes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;

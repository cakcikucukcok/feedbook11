  <title>Into Me I See - Diane L Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had a dream that was not like any I had experienced before.
Reaching the center of the stage, I stated that when we used our five senses to engage with our world, we only experienced a small fraction of the frequencies that actually existed. I continued in this vein, explaining that the limited capacity of our five senses was congruent with our limited conscious connection to life when relying only on our five senses.
Our world, and everything in it that appears solid, was actually approximately 4 percent matter spinning so quickly it created the illusion of a solid mechanistic world. Our world was 96 percent dark matter and dark energy, named so because it was totally unobservable except for its gravitational effect.
Upon waking, I went in search of what information I could find. To my amazement, there was quite a bit of information about a study of science called quantum physics, and many experiments had confirmed that there was a maximum of approximately 4 percent material or matter in our universe and 96 percent dark matter and energy. The math had added up for decades. That fact, if nothing else, could be relied upon.
My mind was racing for two main reasons. Firstly, I had a grade 10 education and no conscious knowledge of quantum physics. Where was this information coming from? Secondly, the information itself was unbelievable.
Fast-forward to approximately twenty-three years, I was still waiting for the science world to reconcile what they call the macro/micro or the equation of everything before quantum theory could be accepted as a law. 
In the meantime, studies proving the connection and consciousness of life continued without moving us into a new paradigm congruent to these connections and the cohesiveness of quantum physics, which continued to reveal.
The time is now, so lets begin together." />

  <title>Magnificence a Mallory O’Shaughnessy Novel - Paula Rae Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MAGNIFICENCE, VOLUME 4 of the Mallory O&#39;Shaughnessy series, finds eighteen year old Mallory OShaughnessy struggling to overcome debilitating injuries inflicted by malicious, murderous Sylvia Brown. Relying on the watchfulness of Daniel and Diana Faulkner, and the power of the Lord, she struggles onward and upward. Can she continue trusting the Lord, even if total healing isnt His will for her life? Can she make a difference for others struggling with overwhelming physical disabilities? Can she keep DiaMo Corporation strong and profitable? Does she have the heart of David Anderson? If so, can she keep it?
And what about Sylvia? Will she receive punishment commensurate with her deeds? Will her powerful and conniving mother step in, once again, on her behalf?
Travels take her to the erupting volcano of Hawaii, to the Summer Music Festival in Aspen, then once more to Israel for an emergency meeting with Lilly to discuss mind-boggling development with diamonds from Pike County Arkansas. A quick trip to Spain regarding leather accessories helps fulfill one of her childhood dreams~to view Gibraltar and its fabled Apes!
Life is never dull, as her personal security people struggle to protect her diamonds from theft, and ensure her personal safety. Threatened by numerous outer adversaries, she knows the greatest threat is from within: her own innate desire to rebel and do things her own way!
Watch for the final title, RADIANCE.

  <title>Cast In Shadow (The Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1) - Michelle Sagara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Seven years ago Kaylin fled the crime-riddled streets of Nightshade, knowing that something was after her.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Children were being murdered—and all had the same odd markings that mysteriously appeared on her own skin. … Since then, she’s learned to read, she’s learned to fight and she’s become one of the vaunted Hawks who patrol and police the City of Elantra.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alongside the winged Aerians and the immortal Barrani, she’s made a place for herself, far from the mean streets of her birth. But children are once again dying, and a dark and familiar pattern is emerging. Kaylin is ordered back into Nightshade with a partner she knows she can’t trust, a Dragon lord for a companion and a device to contain her powers—powers that no other human has.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her task is simple—find the killer, stop the murders…and survive the attentions of those who claim to be her allies!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Items of Interest, Or, Possibly Not - Don Foltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book begins with the authors personal views of his early childhood and life on a little farm in rural Michigan in 1945. As you read these humorous essays keep in mind they actually happened. Some, well most, have evolved over the years into a blend of fact and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you follow along through school, a stint in the Army, marriage, raising a family, thirty years with General Motors and a second career on Mackinac Island, humor is not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With friends, four highly inquisitive kids, an equally imaginative wife and the authors own array of blunders, topics are found aplenty. It only takes a bit of doctoring with half truths and the occasional lie and we have a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it will bring back to the reader pleasant memories of times past and a few chuckles.&lt;/p&gt;" />

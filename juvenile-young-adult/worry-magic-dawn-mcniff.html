  <title>Worry Magic - Dawn McNiff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilarious, heartfelt, and with family at its core, this comforting story is for anyone who just can&#39;t help worrying!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Courtney is a worrier - she&#39;s worried about EVERYTHING, from her mum and dad&#39;s constant fights, to her Gran being ill, to the fact that her best friend Lois suddenly seems to be more interested in growing up and hanging out with mean girl Bex than with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   But then one day, during a particularly bad argument kicked off by her dad&#39;s discovery of a pig in their lounge (don&#39;t ask...), Courtney begins to feel  a bit funny... a bit woozy... a bit like a dream is coming on - and then when she wakes up everything is better! Mum and dad are being nice to each other, the pig is going back to the animal shelter (really, don&#39;t ask...) and even Kyle, her older brother, seems to be making an effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Courtney becomes sure that each time she feels woozy and has her dreams, she&#39;s magicking her problems and worries away. Her mum, dad and brother aren&#39;t so sure though. Can Courtney convince everybody that her worry magic dreams are the perfect way to solve her problems? Or should she learn to worry a little less and to ask for help in some non-magical places more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

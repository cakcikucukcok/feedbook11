  <title>Heart Of A Lawman - Patricia Rosemoor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Quarrels boys are back in town to save the family homestead and make peace with each other. But will a hidden danger threaten all they hold dear?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A WOMAN WORTH FIGHTING FOR&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A shattering tragedy sent Bart Quarrels back to his ailing father&#39;s bedside. But being home brought little peace to the lawman, for there was something wrong at the family ranch–something the beautiful new horse wrangler wasn&#39;t telling him…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Josie&#39;s past was a mystery, even to her. All she knew was that someone was after her–someone on the ranch. But Josie&#39;s missing memory didn&#39;t prevent her from falling hard for Bart, a man who made her feel safe. Protected. Cherished. Would Bart be able to protect her from the past that haunted her dreams–and threatened her future with him?&lt;/p&gt;

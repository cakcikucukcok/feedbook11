  <title>A Crack in the Clock - Brittany Harris, Morgan Pairo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When, Yaoke Hikari, a young high school girl, wakes up on the morning of her first day of school to find a pocket watch under her pillow, she tries to find the owner, but on her way back to her dorm, she is attacked by a creature who tells her that his master wants what she has, the small watch she has found. Soon her two roommates, and best friends, Kyoki and Hana, have watches of their own and are transported to a world where magic and knights who use it abound, fighting against an enemy that had once been an ally. Friendships are tested as new and old companions are brought together and torn apart Thrown into a fight that was never theirs, they must find the courage and strength within themselves to battle against destruction and madness, coming face to face with their own darkness, or break in the attempt." />

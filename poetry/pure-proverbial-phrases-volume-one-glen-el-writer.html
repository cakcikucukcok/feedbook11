&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Poetry is the summary of life. People write poems to summarize celebration and strife. Proverbial Phrases are simple words that slice like a knife. Some will praise them, while others may say they are too hard, or nice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of Proverbial Phrases should read them with open minds. Dreams, science, sexuality, religion, are but a few of the items dealt with in these writings. One should know that Proverbial Phrases are written to inform readers of the writers purpose. That purpose is to stimulate others to summarize their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World War II veteran, Chandler Mann, handed down some of his most personal Proverbial Phrases to a youngster named Kendall Ryan Belcher. Kendall, determined to honor his mentors work, now works to see that each Proverbial Phrase is written in its purest form, straight from its purest origin, Chandler Mann. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Proverbial Phrases may seem difficult to understand. Some Proverbial Phrases may seem too simple. Yet, one must know that each Proverbial Phrase teaches a tangible lesson. One may often have to further search out such lessons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy Pure Proverbial Phrases, whether you read them on the go or at home, and feel free to share them with anyone, wherever you roam.&lt;/div&gt;

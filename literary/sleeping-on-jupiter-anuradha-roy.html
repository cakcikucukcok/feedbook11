  <title>Sleeping on Jupiter - Anuradha Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, a novel about violence, love, and religion in modern India&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a train bound for the seaside town of Jarmuli, known for its  temples, three elderly women meet a young documentary filmmaker named  Nomi, whose braided hair, tattoos, and foreign air set her apart. At a brief stop en route, the women witness a sudden assault on Nomi that leaves her stranded as the train pulls away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in Jarmuli, among pilgrims, priests, and ashrams, the women disembark only to find that Nomi has managed to arrive on her own. What is someone like her, clearly not a worshipper, doing in this remote  place? Over the next five days, the women live out their  long-planned dream of a holiday together; their temple guide pursues a  forbidden love; and Nomi is joined by a photographer to scout locations  for a documentary. As their lives overlap and collide, Nomi&#39;s past comes  into focus, and the serene surface of the town is punctured by violence  and abuse as Jarmuli is revealed as a place with a long, dark history  that transforms all who encounter it. A haunting, vibrant novel that was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and the DSC Prize for South Asian  Literature and short-listed for the Hindu Literary Prize, Anuradha Roy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Sleeping on Jupiter&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliantly told story of contemporary India from an internationally acclaimed writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Event tree analysis Third Edition - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What other jobs or tasks affect the performance of the steps in the Event tree analysis process?  How did the Event tree analysis manager receive input to the development of a Event tree analysis improvement plan and the estimated completion dates/times of each activity?  How much does Event tree analysis help?  Are assumptions made in Event tree analysis stated explicitly?  What are your current levels and trends in key measures or indicators of Event tree analysis product and process performance that are important to and directly serve your customers? how do these results compare with the performance of your competitors and other organizations with similar offerings?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Event tree analysis investments work better.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

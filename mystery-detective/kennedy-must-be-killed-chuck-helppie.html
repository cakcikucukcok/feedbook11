  <title>Kennedy Must Be Killed - Chuck Helppie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a young CIA officer, Patrick McCarthy witnesses first-hand JFKs political immaturity and personal recklessness. When Kennedy is elected in 1960, Patrick fears that Kennedy is unprepared to lead the nation in the height of the Cold War. After the near catastrophic events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, The Patriots, a shadowy group of powerful men, decide to take action before Kennedys next political blunder destroys the country. Patricks devotion to protecting his country ensnares him in the conspiracy to assassinate the president. 
After the assassination, Patrick assists in orchestrating the Warren Commission cover-up. He realizes too late that he has been duped by those he trusted. Years later, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reopens the investigation and subpoenas Patrick to testify. Patrick grapples with the decision to reveal the trutha truth which will re-write American history and destroy the reputations and fortunes of some of Americas most powerful men. 
KENNEDY MUST BE KILLED chronicles the life of Patrick McCarthy from the time he arrives in postwar Washington D.C. as an idealistic, patriotic young man to that fateful day on the grassy knoll when he destroys the heart of the nation. It is a story about one mans love for his country, love for his wife and family, and an act of betrayal that causes him to lose everything that he holds dear." />

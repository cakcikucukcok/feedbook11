  <title>Alchemy: Ancient and Modern (Illustrated) - H. Stanley Redgrove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alchemy is generally understood to have been that art whose end&lt;br /&gt;
was the transmutation of the so-called base metals into gold by&lt;br /&gt;
means of an ill-defined something called the Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Stone; but&lt;br /&gt;
even from a purely physical standpoint, this is a somewhat&lt;br /&gt;
superficial view. Alchemy was both a philosophy and an&lt;br /&gt;
experimental science, and the transmutation of the metals was its&lt;br /&gt;
end only in that this would give the final proof of the alchemistic&lt;br /&gt;
hypotheses; in other words, Alchemy, considered from the physical&lt;br /&gt;
standpoint, was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally on the&lt;br /&gt;
material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of the&lt;br /&gt;
Cosmos. We see the genuine scientific spirit in the saying of one of&lt;br /&gt;
the alchemists: &amp;ldquo;Would to God . . . all men might become adepts in&lt;br /&gt;
our Art &amp;mdash; for then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its&lt;br /&gt;
value, and we should prize it only for its scientific teaching.&amp;rdquo;1&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, however, not many alchemists came up to this ideal;&lt;br /&gt;
and for the majority of them, Alchemy did mean merely the&lt;br /&gt;
possibility of making gold cheaply and gaining untold wealth." />

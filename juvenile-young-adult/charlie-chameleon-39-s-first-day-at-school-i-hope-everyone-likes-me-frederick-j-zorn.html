  <title>Charlie Chameleon&#39;s First Day at School: I Hope Everyone Likes Me! - Frederick J. Zorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is &quot;Charlie.&quot; This is my story about starting school. I was very excited and couldn&#39;t wait to go. When we got there, I saw lots of people I didn&#39;t know and wanted them all to like me. &lt;br&gt;But wait &#39;till you hear what happened! One boy didn&#39;t like my name. A girl couldn&#39;t tell what I drew in art class. A boy didn&#39;t like my shirt. Another boy said I was too tall, and a girl said I was too short. I got all mixed up. I knew what they said wasn&#39;t right, but I wanted to please. That&#39;s when I became &quot;Charlie Chameleon.&quot; &lt;br&gt;I told my parents what happened - how I kept changing so that everyone would like me. They told me I didn&#39;t have to do that. I was okay just the way I was, and real friends would like me just the way I was, too. They said I should believe in myself and always do what I know is right. I should not always listen to what others want me to do, or I won&#39;t be who I really am. I&#39;m glad I found this out. &lt;br&gt;My parents said they liked me just the way I was. That made me very happy! I like me just the way I am, too! And you know what? My real friends were very glad I learned to do what I thought was right. They said I helped them want to be who they really are, too. I hope you like my story. XOXOXOXOXO Your friend, Charlie &lt;br&gt;P.S. &quot;Charlie&quot; has been used in Kindergarten through 4th Grade classes and reviewed by  teachers, principals, counselors, psychologists, clergy, parents, and grandparents. The story has been very well received as a fun read and as timely and useful for dealing with issues so prevalent in our society today of bullying, self-image, and the courage to say &quot;NO!&quot; to peer pressure.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Frederick J.

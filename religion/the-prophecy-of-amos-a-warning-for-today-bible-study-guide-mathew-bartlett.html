  <title>The Prophecy of Amos - A Warning for Today: Bible Study Guide - Mathew Bartlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The virtually unknown prophet Amos bursts onto the pages of history with a warning relevant to his time. He confronts the nation of Israel with the unchanging nature of God and warns them to repent before judgment falls. As we study a period in the history of a nation that had turned its back on God, we draw disturbing parallels with our own time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With verse by verse commentary and explanatory notes, Amos: A Warning for Today provides a simple introduction to the study of a period of backsliding in Israel&amp;rsquo;s history &amp;ndash; and the warning from the prophet which read through modern eyes appears so relevant to our present time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PLUS: LIFE APPLICATION NOTES &amp;amp; STUDY QUESTIONS FOR EACH CHAPTER CONNECT THE LESSONS OF AMOS TO YOUR OWN LIFE SITUATION!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;SUITABLE FOR HOME GROUPS, CHURCHES AND INDIVIDUALS&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BUILD YOURSELVES UP IN THE MOST HOLY FAITH&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Amos was a shepherd from the southern part of Jerusalem who God called to leave his homeland and prophesy to the Northern Kingdom&amp;mdash;Israel. Amos prophesies of judgment to Judah, Israel, and the surrounding nations. Israel specifically has rebelled against God. It has become complacent because of its wealth, idolatrous as it worshiped false gods, and unjust as it oppressed the poor. Though Amos prophesies of God&amp;rsquo;s judgment to Israel, he also continually intercedes for them throughout the book&amp;mdash;asking God to be merciful (Amos 7). This book certainly has many applications and warnings for the people of God today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Mathew Bartlett and Derek Williams skillfully bring out the historical background, the meaning, and the applications in The Prophecy of Amos: A Warning for Today. With each verse, commentary is provided to help the reader understand and apply the text. Here is an example of the rich applications in considering Amos&amp;rsquo; background as a shepherd from Amos 1:1:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;God&amp;#39;s choice of Amos shows how God calls the weak and ordinary instead of the wise and strong. (1 Cor. 1:26&amp;ndash;27). Amos was a nobody, but God revealed Himself to Amos through His word, just as today He reveals Himself to all who put their faith in His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This commentary is a breath of fresh air. It is easy to read and brings out the urgent message of the book of Amos for today. Lord, please give us ears to hear! - &lt;em&gt;Greg Brown, Author / Publisher at The Bible Teacher&amp;#39;s Guide, Chaplain at Handong Global University and LCDR, Chaplain at United States Navy Reserve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>King’S Castle - Karl McIntosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a lovely book about how we can, if we work on it, help each other and benefit from all we have.
King Williams set out to find a better place for his people to live so they dont have to live in leaky and flooded shacks. Along the way they find a mountain they can cut into to make a place for the people to live high and dry. Finding a large cave in the side of the mountain would give them a place to start. So by moving in, they could get out of the mud. They planted gardens in the valley only to find some of the crops were missing. 
On their journey, they come across thieves and Indians. Can this be good? The king must find a way for all to live in peace. With the help of his kingdoms people, they can all come together." />

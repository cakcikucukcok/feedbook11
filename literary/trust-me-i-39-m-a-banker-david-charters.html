  <title>Trust Me, I&#39;m a Banker - David Charters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;American Psycho&lt;/i&gt; comes this hilariously cynical and often-brutal novel skewering the world of investment banking, set in the heart of London high finance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Dave Hart, just your typical investment banker. It&#39;s not long until Bonus Day, the most important day of the year, and anything less than a million pounds would be an insult. After all, Dave has to buy a new car, a new Rolex for his wife, and a second home in the country. Not to mention support a few personal habits, legal or otherwise, that gentlemen bankers don&#39;t discuss in public. Unfortunately, a million really isn&#39;t what it used to be, and no one else seems to value Dave as much as he knows he&#39;s worth. Luckily, competence and charm have never been accurate barometers for success in high finance, and Dave just might be able to weasel and blunder his way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremely funny and razor-sharp, &lt;i&gt;Trust Me, I&#39;m a Banker&lt;/i&gt; is the tale of one man&#39;s quest for outrageous compensation and alpha status in a world where pitiless ambition, insecurity, and moral ambiguity are second nature and glitter is far more important than gold. This flawless social satire is a highly enjoyable voyeuristic glimpse into our modern culture of narcissism, materialism, and bottomless greed.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Greek Angels In the Lion&#39;s Den - Nicolette Chelios</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Greek Angels in the Lion&#39;s Den is a candid and passionately written memoir, eight years in the making, introducing the reader to a motherless daughter. Nicolette worked hard to discover her roots and identity while living with a mean-spirited and abusive Greek &quot;stepmother&quot; and an aloof, womanizing Greek father. This memoir addresses more than what one thinks exists in Greek households and what has been portrayed in a popular Greek film and its sequel. On the contrary, this memoir delves deeply into spousal and child abuse, alcoholism, ethnocentrism, racism, poverty, sports fame, health issues, the Greek underworld, sexism, arranged Greek marriages, and the effects these issues have had on the mental and physical health of those family members and friends." />

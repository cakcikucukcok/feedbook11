  <title>Saltwater Girl - C.S. Hagen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel by C.S. Hagen is both an unexpected love story in a time and place of great violence and prejudice and a stirring tale of a man running from his past who challenges the British opium monopoly in China known as the Combination. 
Saltwater Girl is set during the Boxer Rebellion (1900)  - an anti-imperialist struggle waged by North China&#39;s commoners clinging to ancient mystic beliefs against a decadent Qing Dynasty and foreign aggression.  Set in colorful strokes against a broad historical canvas including the Western nations vying for China&#39;s treasures, one man - James Innocent - disguised as a Lutheran reverend and AWOL from the US First Marine Corps, delves deeply into the opium trade in an attempt to destroy the Combination&#39;s powerful consortium. From inside  the port city Tientsin (Tianjin) where foreigners and Celestials (locals) are divided into two parts, two wars emerge - the war against opium and the war against aggression. The Reverend not only finds his own life in danger , but struggles against falling for a Saltwater Girl - a river prostitute - who he believes may be his only friend.  
Filled with sensual imagery  amidst breathtaking devastation and beauty, the Saltwater Girl is a rare look into colonial and Chinese history, the clash of cultures and the ravages the opium trade brought to the Asian masses." />

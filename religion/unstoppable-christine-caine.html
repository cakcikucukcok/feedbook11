      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/em&gt; will encourage you to run the race God has placed before you with new confidence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Joyce Meyer, Bible teacher and bestselling author&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now includes discussion questions for small-group study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you been a spiritual spectator for too long, waiting on the sidelines, thinking God could never use you for something big? Maybe you have been searching for greater purpose. Well get prepared, because God has a baton ready to put in your hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine Caine didn&amp;rsquo;t think she had what it took to make a difference in the world. Then, inspired by her love of Olympic relays, Caine decided that she should start a relay herself&amp;mdash;a global team of individuals and organizations passing a baton to one another in a race to end human trafficking. Now Caine&amp;rsquo;s organization, A21, is on a mission to end slavery, one woman, one man, one child, at a time which sometimes means operating in some of the most dangerous situations on earth&amp;mdash;all because Caine realized that with God leading the relay, she was unstoppable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fascinating stories and inspiring Scripture, Unstoppable takes us on Caine&amp;rsquo;s journey from feelings of inadequacy to trust in God&amp;rsquo;s provision to joy in seeing victory over suffering. Her remarkable story inspires us to embrace the power of being on God&amp;rsquo;s team&amp;mdash;whether we are fighting human trafficking, leading a church, or starting a movement for good in our own community. No longer stuck on the sidelines, we will see how God has uniquely prepared us for the big dreams He calls us to carry out in His name.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think your faith isn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough to conquer something big like human trafficking, think again. In Unstoppable, you will learn to recognize what you can do, knowing that when God calls your name, you will be ready, hand outstretched to receive the baton.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Selling Hope - Kristin O&#39;Donnell Tubb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Selling Hope&lt;/i&gt; is an inventive middle grade novel about a girl who wants a normal life and how she sees Halley&#39;s Comet as her ticket out of the vaudeville circuit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s May 1910, and Halley&#39;s Comet is due to pass thru the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. And thirteen-year-old Hope McDaniels and her father are due to pass through their hometown of Chicago with their ragtag vaudeville troupe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope wants out of vaudeville, and longs for a &quot;normal&quot; life -- or as normal as life can be without her mother, who died five years before. Hope sees an opportunity: She invents &quot;anti-comet&quot; pills to sell to the working-class customers desperate for protection. Soon, she&#39;s joined by a fellow troupe member, young Buster Keaton, and the two of them start to make good money. And just when Hope thinks she has all the answers, she has to decide: What is family? Where is home? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[An] oft-engaging, pleasantly romantic romp through a fascinating time in America&#39;s entertainment history.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

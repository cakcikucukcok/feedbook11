  <title>The Fifth Age; Verdan Chronicles Volume 9 - David Gerspach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eight books and over two thousand years ago the story of Verdan began with The Fourth Age. The promise of peace continues to prove elusive and once again the world calls upon Celecia and Dakoran to safeguard their future. Mriccon has returned from a realm of the gods with the realization that the world is about to enter The Fifth Age. There&#39;s only one problem...The Fifth Age is not supposed to exist. Terek&#39;s dreams are shattered and all he has left are schemes of vengeance and a plan that may yet doom all life on Verdan. Once again, the Rising Circle surfaces with a plan so subversive that it is both reviled and embraced by those in power. The Fifth Age will take the reader from a prison in Emdon to the palace in Seahaven to the swamps of Kyrotha and to no less than three godly realms. The heroes of the world will suffer losses along the way, but will move forward with grim determination toward a cataclysmic conclusion that will help shape not only the future of Verdan, but of the entire universe." />

  <title>Sea Change - Jorie Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has said that &quot;Jorie Graham&#39;s poetry is among the most sensuously embodied and imaginative writing we have,&quot; and this new collection is a reminder of how startling, original, and deeply relevant her poetry is. In &lt;em&gt;Sea Change&lt;/em&gt;, Graham brings us to the once-unimaginable threshold at which civilization as we know it becomes unsustainable. How might the human spirit persist, caught between its abiding love of beauty, its acknowledgment of continuing injury and damage done, and the realization that the existence of a &quot;future&quot; itself may no longer be assured?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no better writer to confront such crucial matters than Jorie Graham. In addition to her recognized achievements as a poet of philosophical, aesthetic, and moral concerns, Graham has also been acknowledged as &quot;our most formidable nature poet&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;). As gorgeous and formally inventive as anything she has written, &lt;em&gt;Sea Change&lt;/em&gt; is an essential work speaking out for our planet and the world we have known.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Sovereign Soul - Kaite McGrew, Geoffrey Mundon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Independently spiritual women can often feel alone in their religions of one, without the structure to support spiritual growth, or the foundation that faith needs to flourish. Without the support of organized religion, it can be hard to make time, create space, cultivate tradition, or build community so faith can deepen. The Sovereign Soul: A Spiritual-But-Not-Religious Womans Guide to Living a Soul-Centered Life speaks to those challenges and walks the independently spiritual woman through the process of re-discovering her unique relationship with her Sovereign Soul, and then building her life around that relationship.

	Serve your Sovereign Souls mission with great satisfaction and joy
	Create a successful and reliable spiritual practice you can count on 
	Identify your real needs and meet them in soulful ways
	Transform your physical space with Soul-welcoming changes
	Release the barriers to a Soul-centered life peacefully, with ease
	Experience time in a way that is satisfying and meaningful
	Build your spiritual tribe for community, support and inspiration 
Part guidebook, part love story, The Sovereign Soul: A Spiritual-But-Not-Religious Womans Guide to Living a Soul-Centered Life is for all smart, soulful women who long to know themselves deeply but have not yet figured out how to shape a life that supports that.

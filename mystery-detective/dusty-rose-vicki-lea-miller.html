  <title>Dusty Rose - Vicki Lea Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After years of hard work and putting everything on the back burner to make it to the top, Rose was finally where she wanted to be. There were still times in the middle of the night when she found herself wondering what happened to the man she loved, and if he ever thought of her; maybe he was happily married with kids and a dog somewhere.
Little does she know that the mind of a sick killer will bring her face to face with the only man she had ever loved and have her running as the killer tries to take everything away from her, even her life. 
She will find that there is much more to her than being just another pretty singer. 
Go on a journey with Rose as she enters the dark shadows of a twisted mind and tries to get back home and stop the sadistic killer from hurting anyone else" />

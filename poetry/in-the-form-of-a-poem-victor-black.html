  <title>In the Form of a Poem - Victor Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lord gives each of us a task in this life. We grow and learn to listen to Him or we move on in life never hearing His voice. I called out to God and He answered my request. He then gave me my task. This is an account of my life and the amazing work He gave me. It tells of my struggles both as a child and as an adult. How I allowed the Lord to work through me, and then let satan enslave me. The poetry was given as a book of teaching and for spiritual comfort. Yet my fall was of both ignorance and pride. I do thank the Lord for His patience and enduring love. He could have allowed me to die in my many sins. Though instead God waited on me to reach out in repentance. The summary in this book is to ask you, the reader to open your hearts along with your eyes and ears to the counsel of the Holy Spirit. Please study the word of God. Do not just attend some church and take any one persons word about what will happen in the very near future. Many people will be deceived, don&#39;t become one of them." />

  <title>Lady Vanishes - Carol Lea Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From former detective turned noted author and dog trainer, Carol Lea Benjamin, comes the fourth book in the critically-lauded Rachel Alexander mystery series, with a sharp new package--and for the first time in mass market!&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dash, Rachel Alexander&#39;s pit bull terrier, has come to be known as half a sleuthing team. But when not called upon to solve crimes he has another very important job: that of a therapy dog, working with people who are developmentally challenged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady, a mop-coated puli, was the therapy dog at Harbor View, a Greenwich Village home for &quot;throw away&quot; people. But now lady has vanished...and the owner of the home has been killed in a bizarre and mysterious hit-and-run accident. Rachel and Dash are the perfect duo to tackle this mystery: she can find the answers and Dash can bring a sense of calm and order to the residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the pieces start coming together, Rachel and Dash not only expose an ugly plot, but also help some innocent victims find justice in a world that too often ignores them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Wake-Up Calls - Connie Gaertner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the new employee at Watsons Flowers, seventeen-year-old Krista knows she has to concentrate on her job and not on the party she is missing at Bayside Beach on Lake Huron. But all she really wants is to have a summer romance with Jeff Wellington, a fellow student, golfer extraordinaire, and well-known jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Krista ignores Jeffs rather unsavory reputation and immerses herself in lively summer boating and beach adventures with him, she also gets to know her coworkersMario Watson, the owners son and a handsome college student who tests Kristas feelings for Jeff, and Cheyenne, a bizarre and moody girl who seems to know everything about everyone. Even though she is crazy about Jeff, Marios eyes beckon Krista into his life. But it is not long before Krista realizes Mario is dealing with his own set of problems. Torn between two suitors with vastly different personalities, Krista must decide which one is right for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this young adult story, a teenager must balance a new job with the possibilities of romance as she learns to trust her heartand her intuitionto lead her to her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

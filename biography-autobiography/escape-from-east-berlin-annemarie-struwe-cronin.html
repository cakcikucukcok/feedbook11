  <title>Escape from East Berlin - Annemarie Struwe Cronin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born in Berlin in 1928, Annemarie Struwe Cronin witnessed firsthand the Nazi government&#39;s rise to power. She watched the devastation of her hometown by Allied bombing, traveled through the destruction and the dead and dying during the last days of the war in Europe.
Annemarie fought to attain happiness and fulfillment despite unbelievable odds. Struggling through the last battle for Berlin, while trying to return home and search for her family, she used all her strength and determination to not be captured and face the horrors that would ensue. Upon being reunited with her family, the author discovered her brother, Karl, had been sent to a Siberian work camp.
Continuing to fight against the horrors of Communist rule in East Berlin, she ultimately decided to escape. After three attempts and two bullet wounds, she finally reached the sanctuary of the West. There, her beautiful voice and love for life would take her to West Germany and then to North Africa, where she met the man she was destined to marry, Tom Cronin, a United States Air Force major." />

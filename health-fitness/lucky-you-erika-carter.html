  <title>Lucky You - Erika Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;An official Book of the Month Club selection.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Three women, early twenties, find themselves aimlessly adrift in Erika Carter&amp;#8217;s fierce and darkly funny debut novel, &lt;I&gt;Lucky You&lt;/I&gt;. Ellie, Chloe and Rachel are friends (sort of); waitresses at the same tired bar in the Arkansas college town they&amp;#8217;ve stuck around in too long. Each is becoming unmoored in her own way: Ellie obliterates all feeling with alcohol and self-destructive acts of sexual promiscuity; Chloe pulls out patches of her hair and struggles to keep incipient mental illness at bay; changeable Rachel has fallen under the sway of a messianic boyfriend with whom she&amp;#8217;s agreed to live off-grid for a year in order to return to &amp;#147;health&amp;#8221; and asks Ellie and Chloe to join them in &amp;#147;The Project&amp;#8221;. In a remote, rural house in the Ozarks, nearly undone by boredom and the brewing tension between them, each tries to solve the conundrum of being alive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;By turns funny, knowing and hauntingly sad, &lt;I&gt;Lucky You&lt;/I&gt; delivers the kind of study in damage and detachment that made Mary Gaitskill&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Bad Behavior&lt;/I&gt; or Joan Didion&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Play It As It Lays&lt;/I&gt; so memorable. With startling exactitude and wickedly deadpan humor, it lays bare the emotional core of its characters with surgical precision. The writing is deft and controlled, as natural and unforced as breath&amp;#151;which makes it impossible to look away.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Lucky You - Erika Carter</i></b> | "With Lucky You, Erika Carter has written a magnificent novel that pitches and swirls forward as love stories pivot toward heartbreak, power poisons sex, drunkenness turns to sobriety and back to drunkenness again, and misguided people search for things that aren’t to be found, from dark basement bars to the rolling wooded landscape of the Arkansas Ozarks.<br /><b><i>Erika Carter | Lucky You</i></b> | That is what Lucky You, by Erika Carter, is for me. There isn’t a big plot twist that screams “got ya!” at the end, or an event that is a catalyst, or even a happy ending. It is just the life of three young women, and all of their flaws, mistakes, and strengths.<br /><b><i>Lucky You by Erika Carter - Goodreads</i></b> | Erika Carter's work has appeared in the Colorado Review, Meridian, CutBank, and the South Carolina Review, among other literary journals and magazines. She lives in Richmond, Virginia, with her husband, the artist Rob Carter. Lucky You is her first novel.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Lucky You - Erika Carter</a> </h3></p><hr/>

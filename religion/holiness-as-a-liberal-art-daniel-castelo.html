  <title>Holiness as a Liberal Art - Daniel Castelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Holiness is a topic that is rarely discussed in Christian colleges and seminaries, yet the rationale for the existence of these institutions is that they provide environments where people can grow into the image of Christ. In other words, these places exist so that Christians can grow in holiness. The essays collected in this volume treat the theme of holiness from a variety of theological disciplines, all with the purpose of disabusing Christians from mischaracterizations of the theme as well as offering a vision for what the Christian life could look like. In both simple and profound ways, holiness is a liberal art; it is the Christian way and shape of life." />

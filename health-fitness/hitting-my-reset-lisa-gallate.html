  <title>Hitting My Reset - Lisa Gallate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She had never been truly aware of her own mortality until her sister Zoie died as a young adult. When she lost her husband to depression and suicide, and her family lost her brother to brain cancer, she realized how brutally short life could be. After multiple miscarriages, and the deterioration of her mother to Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease, she questioned,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;what did all this grief mean ?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;She decided that it must mean something. Grief had changed her landscape, but it did not define her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitting My Reset&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a memoir that offers comfort to people, from the recently bereaved to those who have lost loved ones years ago, and identifies themes of grief, but defines that there is no right way to grieve. Put simply, grief has no time limit and no calendar. It is an unwavering account of how all sense of meaning in life can be lost, and yet we can reset and reshape our lives. We can live meaningful lives alongside our grief, moving through it and with it, rather than seeking to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an utterly compelling story of one woman&amp;rsquo;s altered landscape. A book for grieving people, for those who love them, and each other&lt;/p&gt;" />

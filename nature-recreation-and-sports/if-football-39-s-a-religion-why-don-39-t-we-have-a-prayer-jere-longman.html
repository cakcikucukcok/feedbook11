  <title>If Football&#39;s a Religion, Why Don&#39;t We Have a Prayer? - Jere Longman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last time a Philadelphia professional sports team won a championship, Ronald Reagan was in the White House and &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; was number one at the box office. No city with all four major sports has gone longer without one. The local NFL franchise, the Eagles, has not won a title since 1960, putting its devoted fans through decades of futility and heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peppered with riotous anecdotes about the grandstand brawlers and football lunatics who make Philadelphia one of the most entertaining places in America to watch a game, &lt;em&gt;If Football&#39;s a Religion, Why Don&#39;t We Have a Prayer?&lt;/em&gt; is the hilarious day-by-day account of the operatic passion of Eagles fans in the buildup to the team&#39;s first Super Bowl appearance since 1981. With outrageous detail and beer-on-your-shoes reporting, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; sportswriter and longtime Philly resident Jere Longman reveals what happens when the losingest sports town in America finally has a shot at winning it all.&lt;/p&gt;" />

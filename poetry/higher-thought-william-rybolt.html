A Lasting Tribute
We honor those who live in fame
Give reverence to those who earn acclaim
Celebrate those of great repute
And dignify those who have been astute
We proudly erect edifices to remember a name
Build statues to edify those who share great gain
With monuments observe men of great thought
Fashion a model for bravery fought
However we choose to compliment
To recognize one whose life has been spent
What ever the mode or the artifact
Time will treat carelessly our commemorative act
That memento of steel or erection of stone
With passing of time will fall on its own
Hopelessly destined forgotten forever
Remembered by few and perhaps even never" />

  <title>Scattering Ashes: A Sister&#39;s Journey With Her Gay Brother - Joyce Smith Helyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scattering Ashes is a resource for Christian families confronting the reality of their loved one&#39;s gay lifestyle. Joyce Smith Helyer takes the reader on a journey that changed her life when her brother began their midnight Christmas Eve conversation with these words, &quot;Joyce, I have something to tell you.&quot; As I waited expectantly for what he was going to say next, he paused, but then shifted the conversation. He tried again, but the same thing happened. I felt like he was trying to land an airplane in trouble and kept circling the airport looking for the best approach. His attempted landings kept falling short of the runway. A vague sense of uneasiness began to fill my mind . . . Little did I realize that my nice, &quot;typical&quot; Christian experience would be undergoing a significant change . . . Fear I could barely articulate almost overwhelmed me . . . Finally, I looked at my handsome, 26-year-old brother and knew the words he was having so much difficulty saying. &quot;Ron, are you trying to tell me you&#39;re gay?&quot; His quiet response echoed across the living room. &quot;I thought you had it figured out.&quot;" />

  <title>Grandma&#39;s Wishes of Love from Heaven - Mary Kay Zotz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her book Grandma&#39;s Wishes of Love from Heaven, author Mary Zotz tells the story of a grandma who sent her grandchildren a note from heaven. She wants them to know she is well and happy. Her favorite pastime in her new home is telling her friends about her wonderful grandchildren and all the memories they made together. She tells them how they laughed, played, and loved together. Grandma&#39;s Wishes of Love from Heaven encourages children, especially young ones, to remember positive experiences about their grandparents, in this case, a grandmother. Although sadness and grief are necessary after the death of a loved one, children should also be reminded of the good times they had with him or her. These memories can then be passed along to their children, keeping family history alive. And, of course, it&#39;s a reminder of being truly loved." />

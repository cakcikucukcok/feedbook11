  <title>London and the South-East - David Szalay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Never before published in the United States, the debut novel by the wildly talented author of Booker Prize Finalist &lt;i&gt;All That Man Is&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That clattering noise you hear is the sound of critics and readers racing to find [David Szalay&#39;s] earlier books, an activity worth the effort,&quot; wrote Dwight Garner in his &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;review of Szalay&#39;s &lt;i&gt;All That Man Is&lt;/i&gt;. And now American readers finally have their chance with his debut novel, &lt;i&gt;London and the South-East&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Rainey, the hapless antihero at the center of this &quot;compulsively readable&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Independent on Sunday&lt;/i&gt;) story works, miserably, in ad sales. He sells space in magazines that hardly exist, and through a fog of booze and drugs dimly perceives that he is dissatisfied with his life--professionally, sexually, recreationally, the whole nine yards. If only there were something he could do about it--and &quot;something&quot; seems to fall into his lap when a meeting with an old friend and fellow salesman, Eddy Jaw, leads to the offer of a new job. But when that offer turns out to be as misleading as Paul&#39;s own sales patter, his life is transformed in ways very much more peculiar than he ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;London and the South-East&lt;/i&gt;, which won the Betty Trask Prize and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, is both a gloriously told shaggy-dog story about the compromising inanities of office life and consumer culture, and the perfect introduction to one of the best writers at work today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

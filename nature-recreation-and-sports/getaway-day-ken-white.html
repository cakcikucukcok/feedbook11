  <title>Getaway Day - Ken White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a father gives to his son, both laugh; when a son gives to his father, both cry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Jewish Proverb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikey Wright is a normal 13-year-old. With normal problems. Until the day he finds out his dad has cancer. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getaway Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; chronicles Mikey&amp;#39;s journey to save his father&amp;#39;s life and learn the meaning of his own. His journey to help his father takes him from the safety and security of his home town to Anaheim, Chicago, and back down Route 66. Along the way, he&amp;#39;s helped by some ordinary and extraordinary folks. Each one has something to teach Mikey about fathers and sons, growing up, family, and home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His efforts are thwarted at every turn, until Mother Nature steps up to the plate. When a freak storm deluges the Bay Area and forces postponement of the 1962 World Series and makes it impossible to practice in nearby San Francisco, the New York Yankees and San Francisco Giants make arrangements to work out in nearby Modesto. Mikey is inches from making his father&amp;#39;s dream come true when an encounter with his high school arch-nemesis threatens to ruin all of his work. Join Mikey as he learns selflessness and the power of believing. He discovers that expectations aren&amp;#39;t real, loneliness is absolute, change is inevitable, and laughter is essential. Ultimately, he learns that growing up means letting go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others is, and remains, immortal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Albert Pike&lt;/p&gt;" />

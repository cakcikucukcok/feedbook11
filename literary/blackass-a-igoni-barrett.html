  <title>Blackass - A. Igoni Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Furo Wariboko, a young Nigerian, awakes the morning before a job  interview to find that he&#39;s been transformed into a white man. In this  condition he plunges into the bustle of Lagos to make his fortune. With  his red hair, green eyes, and pale skin, it seems he&#39;s been completely  changed. Well, almost. There is the matter of his family, his accent,  his name. Oh, and his black ass. Furo must quickly learn to navigate a  world made unfamiliar and deal with those who would use him for their  own purposes. Taken in by a young woman called Syreeta and pursued by a  writer named Igoni, Furo lands his first-ever job, adopts a new name,  and soon finds himself evolving in unanticipated ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Igoni Barrett&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Blackass&lt;/i&gt;  is a fierce comic satire that touches on everything from race to social  media while at the same time questioning the values society places on  us simply by virtue of the way we look. As he did in &lt;i&gt;Love Is Power, or Something Like That&lt;/i&gt;,  Barrett brilliantly depicts life in contemporary Nigeria and details  the double-dealing and code-switching that are implicit in everyday  business. But it&#39;s Furo&#39;s search for an identity--one deeper than  skin--that leads to the final unraveling of his own carefully constructed  story.&lt;/p&gt;" />

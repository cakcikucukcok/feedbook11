  <title>Heartfelt Thoughts: Chapters Two and Three - James L. Harter Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all have gone on family automobile trips to some much anticipated destination. But it is the child who expresses the thrill of what is to come when he pleads incessantly and cries desperately, &quot;Are we there yet!?&quot; 
I feel like that enthusiastic child as I travel through my lifetime journey ever searching for the answers to life. I have experienced the time of my life; yet the mystery lingers and slips through my groping fingers. 
My poetic endeavors reflect that feeling and my mind cries back to me; &quot;Keep exploring, for you will get there!&quot; Join me in the search. I think you will enjoy the trip! 
I&#39;m going from here to there 
...from now to then. Moving on; 
but never back again. Moving on - 
to the other side of the great somewhere." />

  <title>Two Ropes - Bernard Robinson Md.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two Ropes is a carefully written true story about how a young Negro family realized success with the combined support derived from quiet friendships between Blacks and Whites existing in their strongly segregated hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard and Shirley Robinson participated in constructive efforts to penetrate and eliminate racial barriers in their Southern hometown by successfully integrating their respective local university and high school. Their successes were aided by key quiet friendships and collaborations between Negro and Caucasian supporters. In those days, open friendships between Whites and Negro people were not politically healthy for anyone and could even be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Ropes reveals and honors some of those risky friendships in an illustrative and inspirational manner. The book is an easy read, making the point of how much greater America could be if all Americans were free to associate and contribute to the best of their innate abilities without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;" />

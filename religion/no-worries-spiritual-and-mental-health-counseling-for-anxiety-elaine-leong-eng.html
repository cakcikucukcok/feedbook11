  <title>No Worries: Spiritual and Mental Health Counseling for Anxiety - Elaine Leong Eng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This unique, practical, and helpful book describes how faith and psychology can be integrated in the treatment of those who suffer with anxiety. Written by Christian psychiatrist Dr. Elaine Eng, No Worries draws upon years of experience helping people with mental conditions including phobias of various kinds, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and other issues including domestic abuse.  The author describes each condition through composite cases, showing how the symptoms can affect not only the afflicted person&#39;s mental health, but also his or her physical, spiritual, and relational health as well. In addition, she outlines medical and psychological treatment alternatives in each case, while showing how people who care about the afflicted individual can help and provide support. The author&#39;s goal is to help pastors, counselors, and other people-helpers identify symptoms of common disorders related to anxiety so they can provide compassionate, well-informed advice to those who are suffering, usually in silence, loneliness, and fear.   What People Are Saying:   As I travel the world, I see fellow believers suffering from different forms of anxiety and worry. This book gives me tools to recognize when people are suffering and how to encourage them to get the help they need.  - Jeff Seigel, New York Regional Director for Chosen People Ministries  This book is a godsend for providing practical advice about how to include biblical principles in treating anxiety disorders. - Meredith Hawkins, M.D., M.S., Professor of Medicine,  Albert Einstein College of Medicine  A masterful integration of psychology with biblical truth. I joyfully recommend this book to the professors and students in my seminary and to pastors and leaders everywhere. - Dr. Ron Walborn, Dean, Alliance Theological Seminary" />

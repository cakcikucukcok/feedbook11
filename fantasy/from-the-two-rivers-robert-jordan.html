Until the appearance on festival night of Moiraine, a mysterious woman who claims to be an Aes Sdeai--a magician who can wield the One Power. Soon after, the village is attacked by Trollocs--a savage tribe of half-men half-beasts. Rand&#39;s father is nearly killed. But for Rand, the news gets worse. It was not the village the Trollocs were after, Moiraine tells him. It was you, Rand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rand and his friends are forced to flee. But his escape will bring him face to face with the Dark One...the most powerful force of evil in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

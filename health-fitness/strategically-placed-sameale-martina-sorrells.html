  <title>Strategically Placed - Sameale Martina Sorrells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wish I could say I have a PhD or masters in sociology, but I cant. What I do have is experience. Experience with the fear of aging. My Bishop always say, &quot;A man with experience is never at the mercy of a man with an argument&quot;. Which means, an experience cannot be disagreed or argued against, because an experience is real and personal to the one who lived it. 
Strategically Placed for such a time as this, was birth from the fact, so many of us dread aging and sometimes wishes we could either stop the clock, or turn back the hands of time. Not realizing we were strategically placed in the earth for such a time as this.(esther 4:14).
God knew you before you were born (jer.1:5. 
Your birth was set for this particular day and this particular time (eccles.3:2). HE NEEDED YOU! 
In this book, I will talk about some negative thoughts associated with aging and will share with you how to overcome them. You will learn to age with confidence and joy as you anticipate Gods next strategic move in your life. Realizing, ITS ALL APART OF GODS PLAN.. HE GOT YOU COVERED!!" />

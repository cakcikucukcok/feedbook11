  <title>Historical Dictionary of Malaysia - Ooi Keat Gin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malaysia is one of the most intriguing countries in Asia in many respects. It consists of several distinct areas, not only geographically but ethnically as well; along with Malays and related groups, the country has a very large Indian and Chinese population. The spoken languages obviously vary at home, although Bahasa Malaysia is the official language and nearly everyone speaks English. There is also a mixture of religions, with Islam predominating among the Malays and others, Hinduism and Sikhism among the Indians, mainly Daoism and Confucianism among the Chinese, but also some Christians as well as older indigenous beliefs in certain places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This second edition of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Historical Dictionary of Malaysia &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;contains a chronology, an introduction, appendixes, and an extensive bibliography. The dictionary section has over 500 cross-referenced entries on important personalities, politics, economy, foreign relations, religion, and culture. This book is an excellent resource for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more about Malaysia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

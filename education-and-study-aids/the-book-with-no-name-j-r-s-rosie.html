  <title>The Book with No Name - J.R.S, Rosie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The reason for why we decided to write this children&#39;s book is because as my wife teaches she noticed that there are some children that are not up to speed because of their home-life or they have experienced a disaster in their little lives. I was up late one evening or about 2-3am and I just started to write and what inspired me to write was that I enjoy listening to music. My wife and I decided that this is an opportunity for us to prove to ourselves that these children have too much on their plates and to have been in some of these same situations as a young child I and my wife had encountered the very same thing as these children today. We also wanted to show children that being different is okay. Being a little uncomfortable about being different is also okay. We also know that one should never judge anybody for being different, having a disability, or just being a loner. So by writing this book it gave us incite to helping young readers to overcome their troubles of everyday life problems. So we hope to help these young readers to believe in themselves and to have a sense of belonging as well as being comfortable within these social norms." />

  <title>Angry Optimist - Lisa Rogak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Bestseller &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since his arrival at &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt; in 1999, Jon Stewart has become one of the major players in comedy as well as one of the most significant liberal voices in the media. In &lt;i&gt;Angry Optimist,&lt;/i&gt; biographer Lisa Rogak charts his unlikely rise to stardom. She follows him from his early days growing up in New Jersey, through his years as a struggling standup comic in New York, and on to the short-lived but acclaimed &lt;i&gt;The Jon Stewart Show&lt;/i&gt;. And she charts his humbling string of near-misses--passed over as a replacement for shows hosted by Conan O&#39;Brien, Tom Snyder, and even the fictional Larry Sanders--before landing on a half-hour comedy show that at the time was still finding its footing amidst roiling internal drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there, Stewart transformed &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt; into one of the most influential news programs on television today. Drawing on interviews with current and former colleagues, Rogak reveals how things work--and sometimes don&#39;t work--behind the scenes at &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show, &lt;/i&gt;led by Jon Stewart, a comedian who has come to wield incredible power in American politics.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Killer Stuff - Sharon Fiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this dynamite series debut, Sharon Fiffer has introduced an engaging and enterprising heroine in Jane Wheel. Recently laid off from her advertising job, separated from her husband Charley, and colliding head-on with a midlife crisis, Jane is trying to make ends meet as an antique &quot;picker&quot; foraging for killer stuff at suburban Chicago&#39;s estate sales and auctions, garage sales and flea markets.t&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long she&#39;s addicted to the hunt, spending her Friday nights with the classified ads and a street map, outlining her weekend plan of attack. Jane knows that finding the real treasures is all about being in the right place at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as she&#39;s settling in to her new routine, Jane finds herself in just the wrong place and at quite the wrong time: stumbling over her neighbor Sandy&#39;s dead body. Soon she&#39;s the prime suspect. After all, everyone on the block seems to have seen her kissing Sandy&#39;s husband at a recent dinner party. Leaning on her best friend Tim, a flower shop owner and fellow junk hound, as well as Evanston police detective Bruce Oh, Jane has no choice but to hunt for the truth. Hopefully her knack for uncovering valuables in the least likely of places will extend to discovering clues as well. Like the vintage postcards, Bakelite buttons, and Fulper lamps that she dreams of finding, to Jane the truth just might be priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Fiffer&#39;s mystery debut is a fabulously entertaining read and an intriguing puzzle featuring a heroine that&#39;s a dynamic mix of Miss Marple, Kinsey Millhone, and Leigh and Leslie Keno.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Most Wanted Man in China - Fang Lizhi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited memoir by Fang Lizhi, the celebrated physicist whose  clashes with the Chinese regime helped inspire the Tiananmen Square  protests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang Lizhi was one of the most prominent  scientists of the People&#39;s Republic of China; he worked on the country&#39;s  first nuclear program and later became one of the world&#39;s leading  astrophysicists. His devotion to science and the pursuit of truth led  him to question the authority of the Communist regime. That got him in  trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1957, after advocating reforms in the Communist  Party, Fang -- just twenty-one years old -- was dismissed from his  position, stripped of his Party membership, and sent to be a farm  laborer in a remote village. Over the next two decades, through the  years of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, he was  alternately denounced and rehabilitated, revealing to him the pettiness,  absurdity, and horror of the regime&#39;s excesses. He returned to more  normal work in academia after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, but the  cycle soon began again. This time his struggle became a public cause,  and his example helped inspire the Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Immediately after the crackdown in June 1989, Fang and his wife sought  refuge in the U.S. embassy, where they hid for more than a year before  being allowed to leave the country. During that time Fang wrote this  memoir &lt;i&gt;The Most Wanted Man in China&lt;/i&gt;, which has never been  published, until now. His story, told with vivid detail and disarming  humor, is a testament to the importance of remaining true to one&#39;s  principles in an unprincipled time and place.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Bear and His Daughter - Robert Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;From a National Book Award winner, &amp;ldquo;a volume of short stories that belongs alongside Raymond Carver&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;brilliant, moving, often gloriously funny&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Spanning nearly thirty years in the career of the &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt;&amp;ndash;bestselling author of &lt;I&gt;Dog Soldiers&lt;/I&gt;, the stories collected here explore, acutely and powerfully, the humanity that unites us.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; In &amp;ldquo;Miserere,&amp;rdquo; a widowed librarian with an unspeakable secret undertakes an unusual and grisly role in the anti-abortion crusade. In his classic story &amp;ldquo;Helping,&amp;rdquo; the author examines a moment of climactic confrontation in the life of Elliot, a therapist beset by his own demons. &amp;ldquo;Under the Pitons&amp;rdquo; is the harrowing story of a reluctant participant in a drug-running scheme and the grim and unexpected consequences of his involvement. The title story is a riveting account of the tangled lines that weave the relationship of a father and his grown daughter.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; In these stories, Robert Stone&amp;rsquo;s characters tug at the edges of experience, laying bare the truths that keep us alive.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Stone, one of contemporary fiction&amp;rsquo;s big talents, probes his characters to the existential core. At stake in these dazzling stories is nothing less than his characters&amp;rsquo; souls.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;People&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;The landscapes of drug addiction and war and its aftermath are depicted with rueful wit and furious intensity in these seven strongly imagined tales.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. Combining Hemingway-like vigor with Kafkaesque despair&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. Stone has few contemporary peers, and no superiors.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

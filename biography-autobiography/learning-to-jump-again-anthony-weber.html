  <title>Learning to Jump Again - Anthony Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a pastor and teacher, Anthony Weber tried to help people deal with the grief that accompanied the death of a loved one. In 2003, he experienced that loss for himself when his father, a minister and counselor, died of pancreatic cancer while still in his fifties. Suddenly, Anthonys personal experience challenged his carefully crafted theological understanding of pain and grief. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony had to revisit a lot of big questions that he thought were resolved: Why is life so hard? What kind of God allows this, and why? Why do I feel so disconnected from others? How do I handle the roller coaster of emotions? Why am I now consumed by fear? How should I view the presence of pain in the world? How do I, as a pastor, teach my congregation how to pray when I can&#39;t pray anymore? Can I doubt? How long can I cry? And how long will God put up with me? &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning to Jump Again&lt;/i&gt; allows us to grieve at the ripple effect of death, grief, and lossbut not without hope. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read &lt;i&gt;Learning to Jump Again &lt;/i&gt;straight throughexcept for the times I had to stop and wipe away the tears. Refreshingly honest, Anthony&#39;s insightful and winsome writing style helped me process some of the emotions of my own father&#39;s death twelve years ago. I hope this fine book finds its way into the hands and hearts of millions dealing with death and the grief that accompanies it. &lt;br&gt;
Nick Twomey, Founding/Lead Pastor, Bay Pointe Community Church, Traverse City, Michigan &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusually candid account of a man of faith wrestling with God through the death of his father. Anthony Weber brilliantly articulates the raw realities of being enshrouded with grief and the struggle to get beyond. &lt;br&gt;

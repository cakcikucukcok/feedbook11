  <title>A Decade of French Fashion, 1929-1938: From the Depression to the Brink of War - Mary Carolyn Waldrep</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In addition to a world-wide depression and the rise of Fascism throughout Europe, the years between 1929 and 1938 witnessed dramatic changes in women&#39;s fashion. With the turning of the decade, the free and easy fashions of the Roaring Twenties shifted to a softer, more conservative look, with an emphasis on curves rather than angles. Hemlines plummeted almost overnight and did not begin to rise until mid-decade.&lt;BR&gt;These selections from full-color French catalogs produced for the international market from 1929 through 1938 document the changes in fashion&amp;nbsp;from the time of the stock market crash to the dawn of World War II. More than 100 images of day and evening wear illustrate the movement from flapper fashions to a more austere look. Fashion designers, costume historians, costumers, and anyone who loves fashion will treasure this richly illustrated survey." />

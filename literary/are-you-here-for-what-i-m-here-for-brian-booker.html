  <title>Are You Here For What I?m Here For? - Brian Booker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;A brilliant debut.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;CHARLES BAXTER&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;The Soul Thief&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;There&amp;#8217;s Something I Want You to Do&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The suspense creeps in and takes hold in seven stories about troubled characters grappling with rare illnesses, menacing chance encounters, sexual awakening, impending natural disasters, and New Age cults.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Within these pages, the everyday meets the uncanny as two high school friends go out for one unforgettable night. A boy, haunted by dreams of a catastrophic flood, becomes swept up in an encephalitis epidemic. A hypochondriac awaits her diagnosis at a Caribbean health resort. A disease researcher meets his nemesis on a train. A father searches for his missing son in a remote mountain lodge where nothing is quite as it seems. An elderly pharmacist protects his adopted nephew, who found a mermaid in a bottle, from a coastal village gripped by hysteria. A teenager is sent to a &amp;#147;therapeutic&amp;#8221; boarding school with disturbing methods and is reunited with a staff member years later.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even at its most surreal, this polished and lyrical debut remains grounded in the emotional lives of people teetering atop widening chasms of confusion and doubt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brian Booker&lt;/B&gt;&amp;#8217;s stories have been published in the &lt;I&gt;New England Review&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Conjunctions&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;One Story&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Tin House&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Vice&lt;/I&gt;, and elsewhere. He holds an MFA from the Iowa Writers&amp;#8217; Workshop and a PhD in English from New York University, and has been a fiction fellow at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown and at the Wisconsin Institute for Creative Writing. He teaches creative writing at the University of Chicago. &lt;I&gt;Are You Here For What I&amp;#8217;m Here For?&lt;/I&gt; is his first collection of fiction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

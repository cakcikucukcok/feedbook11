  <title>My Biggest Lie - Luke Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;There was a time not long ago when I thought that lying was the most natural thing in the world. It was fun. It was addictive. And I forgot, temporarily, what was true and what was false. Or it was simply that I preferred the false.  It was then that I was found out.&#39;  Liam has it all. In front of him glitters a superb career and a life with the woman he loved from the moment he saw her. But on a feverish night out he loses his job, his home and his girlfriend. He is lucky to escape with his life.   Trying to leave his shame behind in London he flees to Argentina to live honestly, and to write the world&#39;s longest and truest love letter. But Buenos Aires is the most sensual, most duplicitous, city in the world. How will Liam prevent his lies from running away with him?  My Biggest Lie is a wickedly entertaining novel about father figures, second chances and deciding when it&#39;s time to tell the truth." />

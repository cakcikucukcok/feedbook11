  <title>And God Said - Dr. Joel M. Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;For centuries, translations of the Bible have obscured our understanding and appreciation of the original text. Now &lt;I&gt;And God Said&lt;/I&gt; provides readers with an authoritative account of significant mistranslations and shows how new translation methods can give readers their first glimpse into what the Bible really means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;And God Said&lt;/I&gt; uncovers the often inaccurate or misleading English translations of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that quotes from it. Sometimes the familiar English is just misleading. Other times the mistakes are more substantial. But the errors are widespread. This book tackles such issues as what&#39;s wrong with the Ten Commandments (starting with the word &quot;commandments&quot;), the correct description of the &quot;virgin&quot; birth, and the surprisingly modern message in the Song of Solomon, as well as many other unexpected but thought-provoking revelations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed translator Dr. Joel M. Hoffman sheds light on the original intention of the text and the newly developed means that readers can use to get closer to it. In &lt;I&gt;And God Said&lt;/I&gt; his fresh approach has united the topics of religion, language, and linguistics to offer the first modern understanding since the Bible was written.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Anthology of Poetry - Dorothy Rossouw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I attribute this collection of poetry to life.  The closest thing I can only compare it to is painting a portrait of emotion and living.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of words I hope brings to you as much enjoyment as it has for me writing them, the words that helped me grow and helped me to understand that in life there will always be questions, and not all of them hold answers  yet that is O.K!  Sometimes the answers we seek lie within us, we just need to look deep enough and be brave enough to face some truths we may not want to face.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life has been and continues to be a journey of words, and thoughts that become so beautiful once etched on paper, These I have and will always keep so close and dear to my heart.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I share some of them with you.&lt;p&gt;" />

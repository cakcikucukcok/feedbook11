  <title>Abandoned Shopping Carts - William Bezanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an appeal to think clearly for yourself in order to regain a sense of responsibility for taking care of humanity and the world; and it offers a set of suggestions for doing so. The book uses the theme of abandoned shopping carts as a graphic symbol of uncaring relinquishment of responsibility in many areas of life, such as littering, driving rudely, and not voting in elections.
&lt;P&gt;
The world and humanity are falling apart. This book offers a vivid call to action to save them, using a simple model from everyday experience:  not abandoning your shopping carts.
&lt;P&gt;
The solution offered here is that people must regain a sense of spiritual responsibility (not religious, but spiritual) as the most important aspect of living, and that all other forms of responsibility will follow.
&lt;P&gt;
Abandoned Shopping Carts will appeal to people who are disenchanted by society&#39;s wastefulness and neglect, and who want an inspiration for changing their lives for the better.
&lt;P&gt;
People are ready for a book that cuts straight to the truth that we all know inwardly:  we are spiritual beings temporarily living in a physical body, and our prime personal responsibility to ourselves and the world is a spiritual one." />

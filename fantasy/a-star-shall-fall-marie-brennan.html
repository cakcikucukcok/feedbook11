      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Royal Society of London plays home to the greatest minds of England. It has revolutionized philosophy and scientific knowledge. Its fellows map out the laws of the natural world, disproving ancient superstition and ushering in an age of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the fae of the Onyx Court, living in a secret city below London, these scientific developments are less than welcome.

The calamity was caused by a great Dragon--an elemental beast of flame. Incapable of destroying something so powerful, the fae of London banished it to a comet moments before the comet&#39;s light disappeared from the sky.

  <title>Joyful Memories - Lil’ Preacher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I realized that I was the last of my siblings, I decided to put pen to paper and began writing the story of my family history all the way back to the late 1800s. This is the story of a husband and wife who emigrated from Mexico to the United States, who became citizens, and then started a family with hopes of educating their children and becoming prosperous and living the American dream. There were many struggles along the way, especially during the depression years. My family had a strong dedication to the patriotism of the United States and volunteered to enter the military and support the cause during World War II. Through my fathers hard work, the family owned a thriving Mexican food products business. Although I faced many obstacles, I was able to overcome them and pursue my dream of a formal education. I obtained my masters degree at age seventy. I have been married to three different husbands, which presented many opportunities for travel, and I have visited many places around the country and around the world. I have two wonderful sons who have been very supportive in my endeavors." />

  <title>The Book on Making It as a Broker - Scott Peppard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about putting the &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; back in free enterprise. A broker, agent, commissioned salesman/advisor is one of the few remaining vehicles left where a person can call the shots. I penned this to honor that noblest of professions: sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This treatise is for the broker, salesman, advisor, and agent in any industry, who is interested in transforming his practice. I will lay a foundation for building the business; it is to serve as a road map, showing how to double production in half the time and effort. The information that you are about to be exposed to is the result of studying successful people for thirty years and is distilled wisdom of the ages on how the enlightened command huge incomes in all market cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every man who works for someone else dreams about going on his own. After about ten years in the rut system, many decide to take a leap and do something solo and step right out of the pot, into the fire. The deck is stacked against small business, because most are undercapitalized and more significantly, lack the knowledge. There is no other small business than that of a broker with a lower startup cost or higher potential income. This book will give you the knowledge to make it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;" />

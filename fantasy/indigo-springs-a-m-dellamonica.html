  <title>Indigo Springs - A. M. Dellamonica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Indigo Springs is a sleepy town where things seem pretty normal . . . until Astrid&#39;s father dies and she moves into his house. She discovers that for many years her father had been accessing the magic that flowed, literally, in a blue stream beneath the earth, leaking into his house. When she starts to use the liquid &quot;vitagua&quot; to enchant everyday items, the results seem innocent enough: a &quot;&#39;chanted&quot; watch becomes a charm that means you&#39;re always in the right place at the right time; a &quot;&#39;chanted&quot; pendant enables the wearer to convince anyone of anything . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as events in Indigo Springs unfold and the true potential of vitagua is revealed, Astrid and her friends unwittingly embark on a journey fraught with power, change, and a future too devastating to contemplate. Friends become enemies and enemies become friends as Astrid discovers secrets from her shrouded childhood that will lead her to a destiny stranger than she could have imagined . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

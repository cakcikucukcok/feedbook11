&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Black and White into Gray&lt;/em&gt; offers a firsthand account of the everyday lives of adults and children diagnosed with these puzzling disorders. What are these patients thinking? Why do they act the way they do? How can we help them? Through the personal stories of therapist Sarah Kennedy and her patient Keith Conrad, these questions and many others are honestly and clearly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining personal and clinical points of view, Kennedy and Conrad clarify and explain puzzling behavior. They do this by sharing personal experience and stories that are often painful, sometimes humorous, but always helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the personal with the clinical, Kennedy and Conrad share valuable information to help others understand bipolar disorder, Tourette syndrome and mood disorders and to cope with the associated symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Black and White into Gray&lt;/em&gt; will comfort many who feel they are the only ones suffering with these debilitating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being educated, they will be offered gentle guidance through the darkness of fear toward a new horizon of enlightenment and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;" />

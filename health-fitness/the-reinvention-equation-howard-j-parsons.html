  <title>The Reinvention Equation - Howard J. Parsons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reinvention Equation is a practical guide for baby boomers who have lost their rhythm that they were taught growing up as to how the world works.
Howard Parsons had his first taste of life transition at age fourteen when his mother, his best friend, died. His anchor to his world, as he knew it, was gone.
Not knowing how nor having tools to navigate his life, Howard turned to isolation, hard work, and alcohol to make the journey as best as he could.
In the years to follow, Howard learned new skills and techniques to reinvent his life, providing deep satisfaction and gratitude for all that is available.
Here is a blueprint that will show you the process to reinvent your life, get past old ways of doing things, and find once again your essential self as the guiding source in your life. In the new world order, which is not what baby boomers expected, thinking, feeling, and physical actions must be aligned with your essential self." />

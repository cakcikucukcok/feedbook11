  <title>The Rainbow’S Light - Derek Earls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Droplets of evil had diluted and eventually dispersed the white power of the suns special light. The special light had a purpose. It was created for such a time as this. The purpose carried a good intent, but some devilry had diluted and dispersed the good intent. 
It was remembered by those occasions when rainbows arched the sky. The rainbows appeared less to men and others forgot. But most men had forgotten the purpose of the rainbows reminder, and most men and others had never known the purpose of the special light. 
It was always known by a few that such a time as this would come. The few, intent on good, feared the coming of such a time. Now the greater number, who were evil, were aware that the time, or a time, had come. They were, at first, unaware that the special light might reconvene as a whole and that the white power of the whole might thwart their intent. 
These others were not men, not human. Though they had mans outward appearance, most were subhuman; some were superhuman. Evil intent rested with the superhuman; but, to them, the intent was not evil, just inevitable. Only those carried upon the waves of the special light had the energy to combat the evil intent, and then it was only when they came together." />

  <title>What Is That Thing? - Janae Moore D.Min. Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What Is that Thing? is more than a book. It is an experiential spiritual, ontological, and historical journey into the depths of who we really are. This process leads the reader to directly name and face what those things are about them, within them, and around them that tend to keep them from experiencing life to the fullest. Dr. Moore describes this work as a process to be engaged and a journey to be taken together. It is not often that you will find an ordained itinerate elder and licensed clinical social worker use poetry to help individuals become all who God has purposed them to be. Yet this writer, through her poetry, reaches the innermost areas of those who will take this journey that will lead them toward self-examination and healing." />

  <title>The Icons Within - George Pugh, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you can think differently about your personal problems, which might include the aftermath of traumatic events or deep feelings of rejection, you may find yourself in a positon to overcome hurtful memories that continue to upset you and interfere with your sense of self-worth. &lt;p&gt;
George Pugh, Ph.D., a practicing clinical psychologist, helps you find insight and direction in this new approach to understanding yourself and why you struggle with inner self-defeating voices that hold you back. After learning why you are resistant to changing problematic personality traits and why past efforts have left you at a loss and longing for more, you will be encouraged to take part in simple exercises that will remove the troubling inhibitions that prevent you from being who you truly are.&lt;p&gt; 
In straightforward language you will achieve insights that will help you: &lt;p&gt;
	understand that the personality forms around the basic principles of survival; &lt;p&gt;
	recognize that survival strategies that served you well in the past hold you back in the present; &lt;p&gt;
	release your true voice to speak from a position of honesty, integrity and personal strength; &lt;p&gt;
	free what you have hidden  your passion, connection and commitment to your personal journey. &lt;p&gt;
If you are willing to risk brief emotional upheaval and painful moments of reflection you will find your voice and release your true self. &lt;p&gt;
This book explains steps that will allow you to break free of a counterproductive lifestyle that binds you to a way of thinking and feeling that is safe but is lacking in joy and authenticity. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Icons Within&lt;/em&gt; helps the reader to understand the full effects of Iconic therapy. It provides a sense of hope in a multitude of dimensions  hope that healing is possible, hope that life can hold so much more and hope that lifes potential can still be achieved. &lt;p&gt;

  <title>Diary of Agony and Hope: Waves of Folk Sayings in the Ferguson Movement - E. Hammond Oglesby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book, Diary of Agony and Hope, explores the ethical themes of justice and hope through the lens of folk sayings, case studies, and real-life experiences on the part of the writer as a resident of St. Louis County for over thirty years. The writer believes that the tears for the fruits of justice in the Michael Brown, Jr. case are tears that will be further reckoned with in light of their implications for reform--especially in the use of deadly force--among police departments throughout the community of Ferguson and our troubled land. Here every American must work together for a better society! The writer believes that the daunting task of working together will build bridges of trust, understanding, and hope between police officers and the communities in which they serve: particularly communities of color.   Research for this volume was largely taken from the writer&#39;s diary. Insightful and engaging, this book is a &quot;must read&quot; for morally concerned Americans who want to know more about the story of the Ferguson Movement. In the movement itself for justice on the part of peace protestors, we see the force of love among ordinary people of goodwill." />

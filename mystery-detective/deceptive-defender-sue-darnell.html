  <title>Deceptive Defender - Sue Darnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emily Dalton is a newly divorced young mother, struggling to make a living as a Realtor in a rotten economy. Despite the hardships, she is grateful to be free from her abusive ex-husband, Jack Dalton. Just as she&#39;s beginning to relax, Jack launches a campaign to prove Emily an unfit mother and take their little girl away from Emily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Brian McCain, a charming, handsome young man who could be the answer to all of Emily&#39;s problems. He seems to appear out of nowhere, and she soon learns he is an undercover cop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few weeks, Brian pursues Emily relentlessly. But he&#39;s always a protective gentleman. He tells her plenty of details about his work and his personal life. Emily finds herself drawn to this mysterious man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But would an undercover cop give out that much information? As she struggles with uneasy feelings, Jack continues to torment her with threats, pushing her toward the safety of Brian&#39;s arms. Best of all, Brian defends her against Jack&#39;s attacks. Sweet revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Emily allows herself to be pulled more and more into Brian&#39;s life, she soon learns that God has been the one defending and protecting her all along.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Guan-Yu the Hero - Frankie Kt Neo, The Sanfen Tang Collection</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a classic historical novel of enormous influence, is considered to be one of the four great Chinese classic novels. Written by Luo Guanzhong, a scholar who lived in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, it chronicled the efforts of the Wei, Shu, and Wu kingdoms to reunite the empire at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. 
This fascinating period in Chinese history inspired many other authors, poets, artists, and playwrights, including Luo Guanzhongs novel, which is a work of enduring historical and literary impact and beauty. Guan Yu, the hero, has had a significant impact on Chinese culture and the arts. That influence has spread to Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and to all Chinese communities in the world. Guan Yu is well respected and worshiped in Taoism, Buddhism, Shintoism, and Caodaiism. He has also influenced modern entertainment and mass media as well, including television, video games, Manga, and more. The study and critical interpretation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Guan Yu has captivated scholars, artists, and writers for centuries. 
Now, modern-day scholar and collector Frankie KT Neo offers the best of his research. Readers are invited to a detailed tour of his extensive collection of antiques and other artifacts commemorating Three Kingdoms and its hero, Guan Yu. His collection, called the Sanfen Tang Collection, currently features more than a thousand pieces, many of which are detailed within." />

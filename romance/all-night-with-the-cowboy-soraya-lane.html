  <title>All Night with the Cowboy - Soraya Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Billionaires, cowboys, and second chance romance collide in &lt;i&gt;All Night with the Cowboy &lt;/i&gt;by Soraya Lane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACK IN THE SADDLE. STRAIGHT TO THE HEART. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the Ford family ranch, getting thrown from a horse is a part of growing up. But one cowboy is still learning the ropes when it comes to falling in love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanner Ford has been riding bulls and busting broncos his entire life. So when he takes a hard spill--and sustains serious injuries--he refuses to believe his rodeo days are behind him. He&#39;s determined to restore his body and revive his career. There&#39;s just one problem: the finest physical therapist in town just happens to be the only woman he&#39;s ever loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Lewis knows she made a huge mistake when she walked away from Tanner. But she was young, ambitious, and focused on her medical career. Now, after all these years, Tanner&#39;s back--and, in spite of his injuries, looking better than she allows herself to admit. She agrees to work on Tanner&#39;s big bruised muscles until he&#39;s back in bull-riding shape again. But how can Lauren resist the smoldering attraction between her and her old flame. . .and will she be able to live without him? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Lane warms hearts of readers across the globe.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

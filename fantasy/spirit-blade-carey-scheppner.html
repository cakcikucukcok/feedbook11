  <title>Spirit Blade - Carey Scheppner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here today, gone tomorrow
A dead future leads to sorrow.
Things are disappearing, and their disappearance is not being noticed, as parts of history are being erased.  Somehow, the powerful mages discover this problem and know they must act in order to prevent the future from being erased altogether. To do this, someone must travel back in time to the time of the dragon wars, where the origin of the problem seems to originate. Arch Mage Kazin is once again called upon to seek out the problem and neutralize it before its too late.
Kazin recruits some of his former companions and goes further back in time where they must work very carefully so as not to adversely affect history themselves.  Before long, they realize that things are not happening as they should be. History is being altered. Whether directly or indirectly responsible, they soon find themselves chasing a foe far more powerful and omnipotent than they realize.
Join Kazin on this new quest, Spirit Blade, Book III of The Dragon Mage Trilogy, where the past and future collide with explosive fury!

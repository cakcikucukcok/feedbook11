  <title>Daring to Date Again: A Memoir - Ann Anderson Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ann has two kids, two careers, two divorces, a pile of friends and sings soprano in the church choir. But after twelve years single, she is sick of celibacy. She&#39;s been through enough to know that marriage is not what she was brought up to expect, and that love can be slippery and uncertain. With a re-awakened libido and a longing for adventure, she steps outside her comfort zone-embarking on a boundary-pushing, soul-searching journey into the world of online dating.  Ranging from Montclair, New Jersey to Harare, Zimbabwe, Daring to Date Again: A Picaresque Memoir is a compelling, often racy memoir of one woman&#39;s late-life adventures with sex and dating in the modern world. As she rollicks (and bawls) her way through dozens of relationships, Evans tackles some touchy topics with humor and insight: the morality of dating married men, whether women over sixty should consider having children, what age difference is too much, and more. Daring, frank, and a little bit nutty, Daring to Date Again is a story about what happens when a lonely, sex-starved sixty-year-old woman decides to put herself on the market again-but on her own terms." />

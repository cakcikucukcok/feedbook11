One late summer morning, the body of a local caretaker is found in the open water; the same day, a monstrous animal corpse is found on the beach, presumed a casualty from a nearby research lab. With rumors flying, eyes turn to Mills Chevern&amp;#8212;a tumbleweed orphan newly arrived in town from the west with no ties and a hazy history.

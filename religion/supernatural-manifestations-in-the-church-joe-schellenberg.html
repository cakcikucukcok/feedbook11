  <title>Supernatural Manifestations in the Church - Joe Schellenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supernatural Manifestations in the Church&lt;/em&gt; will entice you to pursue the tangibility of the intangible. It may not be the manifestations you are seeking, but they will accompany you as you utilize what is already at work in your life. You can learn how to access the power of gifts, the gifts of revelation, and the utterance of gifts through your own prayer language. Tongues provide a necessary element in releasing the super to the natural. The apostle Paul spoke in tongues more than all the Corinthians. Was there a link between the spiritual revelation he received through this kind of praying and the writing of half the books in the New Testament?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supernatural Manifestations in the Church&lt;/em&gt; contains exhilarating, real-life experiences in accessing the extraordinary working and moving of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Supernatural Manifestations in the Church&lt;/em&gt;, you will receive answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you access the supernatural in your own devotional life?&lt;br /&gt;
How can you know you are not manifesting demons?&lt;br /&gt;
What are these strange utterances all about?&lt;br /&gt;
Will I need years of counseling to get free?&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a special tongue for self-deliverance?&lt;br /&gt;
If Jesus took care of the Devil, then what is this all about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have relegated to the specialist what every believer has access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time to deal with the Devil.&lt;/p&gt;" />

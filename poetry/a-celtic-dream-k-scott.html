&lt;i&gt;A Celtic Dream&lt;/i&gt; introduces a new Alaskan artist and poet, sharing his first compilation of prose, poetry, and artistic expressions illustrating the changing faces of love and life.
Many years ago, K. Scott, known to his friends as Scotty, dreamed about a love unlike anything he had ever experienced. After witnessing the surreal start of a perfect day in a Scottish castle with his beloved highland princess, he found a strong desire to write about love while learning more about his Celtic ancestry. As time progressed, Scotty soon realized that his path in life would be lined with both joy and sorrow. In his collection of lyrical verse, he offers a unique perspective on how he became a better man because of his heartbreakeventually discovering freedom, kindness, and, most importantly, serenity. 
As he shares lessons learned of gratitude and peace with self and God, Scotty bares his Celtic soul, offering the realization that from pleasure and pain comes treasure and gain." />

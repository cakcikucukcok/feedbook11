  <title>Boyle-Breath - Murray L. Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr Boyle was a teacher, but smelly ~ VERY VERY smelly!
Born on Zeronia, but brought up on the planet Earth, he could still come
up smelling of roses? Couldnt he?
Flying pigs, vampire twins ~ indeed dysfunctional families galore wouldnt
help him. Neither would machine-guns, 7 nails, a firestarter, a wrestler,
bullies or Nazi zombies. Bert from Sesame Street would try, religion,
fostering, a dog, and Social Workers too, but School Refusers, anorexia,
depression, airguns, and even political correctness would let evil win
once again...?
Romance, and another teacher from outer space would try to save the day...
It would all turn out for the best, yeah...?
Hey, weve all been to school yeah? We all remember the stinker in the
class yeah? What if it was the teacher?! What if he could smell you out, and change you... It could save your life." />

  <title>Zuma Exposed - Adriaan Basson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the book President Jacob Zuma does not want you to read. From Shaik to &#39;The Spear&#39;, award-winning investigative journalist Adriaan Basson reveals the truth behind Jacob Zuma&#39;s presidency of the ANC and South Africa. From one bad decision to another, this explosive, roller-coaster account traces the unravelling of a likeable but deeply flawed leader who came to power as victim, not visionary. Basson forensically unpacks the charges against Zuma and reveals a president whose first priority is to serve and protect his own, rather than the 50 million people he was elected to lead. To be published on the eve of the ANC elective conference in Mangaung, this is essential reading for any South African who cares about the country they live in." />

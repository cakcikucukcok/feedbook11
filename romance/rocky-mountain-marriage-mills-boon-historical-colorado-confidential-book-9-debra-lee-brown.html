  <title>Rocky Mountain Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) (Colorado Confidential, Book 9) - Debra Lee Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;GAMBLERS AND DANCE HALL GALS MADE A HELL OF A LEGACY FOR A SCHOOLMARM!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Dora Fitzpatrick was determined to run her late father&#39;s saloon–at least until she uncovered the secrets hidden at the Royal Flush. Not the smallest of which concerned Chance Wellesley! Who was this handsome cardsharp who made her feel like his Queen of Hearts?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chance Wellesley could see right off that Dora Fitzpatrick was smart as a whip–and prettier than she realized. Sooner or later she&#39;d deduce his true intentions. But even riskier was how she could make him shuffle his plans and hope for a full house–of marriage, family and lifelong love!&lt;/p&gt;

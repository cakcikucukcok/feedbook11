  <title>Sense of a Hummingbird - Robert H. Nieder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dwelling on the all-time favorite genre of romance, this is a fictional tale that contains slight spiritual messages and subtle social issues sprinkled into it. Billie Barrett was an odd one, straight and true, misery and anger all wrapped into one lonely soul. It is a love story between a young angry, hateful shrimper who lives in the village of Edgewater, which is located along the St. Johns River in northern Florida, and a young Gullah woman who is from an island, St. Helena Island, off the Beaufort coast of South Carolina. Shrimping had been what he had grown into and what he intends to do throughout his lifetime. His world comes crashing down upon him when, after a boating accident, he is washed ashore on a barrier island off the coast in the Gullah region on Hunting Island, South Carolina. After medical attention is given to Billie, he is taken in and cared for by a Gullah family living in St. Helena Island. It is in this household that he meets Bridgette Kamau, who tends to him on a day-to-day basis. Billie has a change of heart and finds himself falling in love. A connection is made between the two, and a story of romance and hope comes to life. As their relationship develops, Billie experiences a change of heart and belief. This story displays how love can change a person whose mind-set was once plagued by ignorance and hatred. A triumph of the good in man over his dark side, Billie Barretts journey to finding love and self-redemption makes this story the perfect personification of the human aspiration to ultimately obtain love, peace, and equality in life. You will read into it what you will and get out of it what you perceive." />

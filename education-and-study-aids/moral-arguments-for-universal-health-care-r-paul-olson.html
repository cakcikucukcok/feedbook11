  <title>Moral Arguments for Universal Health Care - R. Paul Olson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Health care reform is always about more than morality and values, but
if it lacks a moral foundation, it will not stand the test of time. Dr.
Olson provides a moral foundation expressed in eight standards derived
from his study of ethics, systems theory, and health policy research. From
these normative standards he derives a vision of universal health care as
both a public policy of protecting and promoting the health of an entire
population, and a system for organizing, fi nancing, and delivering high
quality care, which is affordable and accessible to everyone based on
their need. Universal health care is fi nanced fairly to ensure sustainability
through shared responsibility with personal choice of health care providers
and/or health care plans. This unifying vision for health care reform is
pluralistic with respect to the design of systems to implement it.
The author provides several moral arguments from divergent ethical
theories, which converge to support his vision of universal health care
and its specifi c elements. In the process, he illustrates how to reason to
moral conclusions based on clear thinking about both values and relevant
facts. He also shows why and how ethical discourse is both relevant and
necessary to the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of health
care policy. Discussion of the controversy over medically necessary care
and an ethical analysis of the Affordable Care Act are unique features of
this book." />

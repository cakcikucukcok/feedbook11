  <title>Faith or Gullibility? - David Rex Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Faith or Gullibility?&quot; was originally written in answer to the author&#39;s many friends who asked why he was no longer attending church but, as time passed and his studies revealed more and more anomalies in religious beliefs around the world, it became very obvious that religious deception was rampant in all doctrines.
This was nowhere more obvious that in the political environments in which those doctrines were originally conceived where necessity demanded some sort of unified stance by different groups of people.  Much more than today, where technology can provide answers, in past centuries, naturally gifted leaders needed convincing stories to persuade the masses to act in harmony to achieve the best outcomes and so those people were, in that environment, lauded as &quot;prophets&quot; and even credited with what became known as &quot;divine inspiration&quot; although, in actual fact, their leading was nothing more than intelligent use of their own intellects.
Nowhere was this more evident than in cases where their prophesies directly contradicted the laws of physics under the name of &quot;miracles.&quot;
A principal problem with this was that, when those so-called prophets expounded their ideas, scientific knowledge was almost non-existent so that rank-and-file people readily accepted them and passed them down from generation to generation - often by word-of-mouth because illiteracy was far more prevalent that it is in modern developed countries.
However, with increased knowledge, human wisdom (the sagacious application of knowledge) has increased exponentially beyond all reckoning amongst open-minded people of all religions to the point where it is no longer possible to justify those outdated beliefs when they are rationalised against the immutable laws of physics.  This is particularly so when one considers that the entire universe (and, in fact, many universes) were all &quot;made&quot; without a single physical law being broken.
As studies become more and more logical, it become more and more apparent that the main reason for religious beliefs (whatever they may be) is insecurity where human nature cannot accept that life is a finite thing.  People cling tenaciously to any doctrine that promises any sort of immortality whether it makes any sense or not and so the purpose of this book increasingly became changed from a mere answer to personal questions to an in-depth study of religious mythology and deception." />

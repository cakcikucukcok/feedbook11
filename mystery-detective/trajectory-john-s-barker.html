  <title>Trajectory - John S. Barker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The truth is, the Cold War didn&#39;t end. The truth is, freedom is a lie. Even today, a handful of men and women control the destinies of civilizations and cultures. Jake Grant was one of those men, a soldier in service to truth, an inside witness to the geopolitical transformation of the world.  In this darkly philosophical tale of espionage, Jake Grant recounts his life as an assassin in the decade leading up to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the shift in world power.    Jake reveals the foundation of a plot, formulated in the 1970s, to engineer the destruction of the Soviet Union, and the struggle of his partner, Stewart Hunt, to stop it. Twisted together through nearly half a century of lies are the lives and loves of the men and women who worked, suffered and died for a fabricated secret cause founded on one man&#39;s personal vendetta. Getting to the truth means getting to know Jake. Knowing Jake means confronting the face of a psychopath, assassin and liar." />

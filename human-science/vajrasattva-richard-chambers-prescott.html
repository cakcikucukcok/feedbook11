  <title>Vajrasattva - Richard Chambers Prescott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To see more manuscripts by Richard Chambers Prescott go to Scribd.com and enter Grascott or PrescottRC.
This book answers the question to the most concealed practice in the Bardo Todol, commonly known as The Tibetan Book of the Dead.  What is the true intent of the Secret of the Four Wisdoms Gathered into the Clear Hollow Mysterious Passage of Vajrasatva?  After eliminating all other possibilities you will discover that Trekcho and Togal are the one answer to this mystery.
The encounter with the Vajrasatva Mystery is an Imbedded Clue to Trekcho and Togal which reveal Clear Light Evenness, not only in the after death state, but equally in the living state.
Trekcho, Letting Go and Togal, the Four Stages of Soaring On or Skull Crossing are the deepest secrets of Dzogchen, the Natural Great Completion.
In Nyingma these are restricted secret practices kept from the public eye.  Whereas, in the Kagyu school and Bonpo tradition these same methods are open to one and all.  You are the decider on these two attitudes.  Let your thought be lighted by the words of the Lion of the Sakyas, 
Ananda? I have set forth the Dharma without making any distinction of esoteric and exoteric doctrine; there is nothing, Ananda, with regard to the teachings that the Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist.  
I hope you will find the freedom of your own experience in the detailed observations and in depth examinations of these secret methods of Dzogchen.
The text is in no way, nor tries to be a teaching text, a manual, nor a guidebook on Trekcho and Togal or Bardo, for I am in no way at all, a teacher, an expert nor a guide in these practices.  Nor do I ever wish to be one.  This essay is an answer to a life long question I have had since reading the Bardo Thodol as a young person.  What is the true meaning of Vajrasattva, the Mysterious Passageway and the Union of the Four Wisdoms?  It just so happens that after one goes through all possibilities of what this means one finally comes to the sacred secret teachings of Dzogchens Trekcho, Togal and Bardo.  So I have had to explain what little that I know about these special secret practices to answer the primary question this text attempts to answer. 
Why wade through the torrent of concepts on this when we can go directly to the clear, most reasonable and satisfactory answers that leave no shadow of hesitation?
Vajrasattva stands for the Primordial Clear Light Void as Love and Compassion.  The secret Mysterious Way of the pure Clear Passage of Vajrasatva is the Kati, running from the Heart to the Eyes.  Within this Kati are the Four Lamps.  From Clear Light, through the Open Kati these Lamps give forth an arising to the Four Togal Appearances. 
Since it is found in the highest wisdom texts from Dzogchen on Trekcho, Togal and Bardo and Tibetans favorite book on guidance in the afterlife, it is worthy of taking a serious look." />

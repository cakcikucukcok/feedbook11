  <title>Peter Rock Star from Galilee: A Guided Bible Study for Teens and Adults - Sherree G. Funk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If the New Testament were a Broadway musical, Peter would be one of the stars. He lived life loud, while making his best effort to be one great disciple. Peter was like a modern day rock star, but his struggles were just like ours. If Jesus could shape Peter into a solid rock of a disciple, he can surely do the same for you. From his first call to follow, Peter was acutely aware of his own sinfulness. He wanted Jesus to go away, but ended up following. What makes people push Jesus away today? What makes them decide to follow? These are the kinds of &quot;chew on this&quot; questions you&#39;ll find in Week One of Peter: Rock Star from Galilee.? Music always speaks to a deep place in the heart. With the playlists in each chapter, you can let the study themes sink in. The ups and downs of Peter&#39;s life story will come alive as you listen to the music of Tenth Avenue North and other artists. To better understand the feelings Peter had after denying Jesus three times, listen to Josh Wilson&#39;s &quot;Before the Morning.&quot; Feel the love Christ had for all people even on the cross by listening to &quot;Amazing Love&quot; by Chris Tomlin. By the end of the eight-week study, you will create your own playlist of at least eight songs to bring back all you learned about Peter.  The digital edition includes links to helpful websites and scripture apps.  All you need for an eight week study is included:  interactive questions for personal study and &quot;chew on this&quot; questions for small group discussion; photographs, maps, and informative sidebars for historical and geographical context; hands-on mission activities and discipleship challenges." />

  <title>Vocation in Black and White - Association of the Monasteries of Nuns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Within the Dominican Order, whose motto is Truth and whose mission is the
proclamation of that Truth, some proclaim primarily through their contemplative
&#39;tryst&#39; with that Truth. Here some of these women of the Dominican monasteries
tell of how they came to embrace this way of life which to many is such a
mystery. Each is a story as unique and human as its author.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Suzanne Noffke, O.P., Translator of the &lt;i&gt;Dialogue of St. Catherine of Siena&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The life of the cloistered contemplative nun is one of the most hidden but also
one of the most important treasures of the Church. The prayers and sacrifices of
these holy women are so crucial to the Church&#39;s well-being that it behooves all
of us to know them better. The stories in this splendid book help us to do just
that, since they are authentic vignettes from the personal lives of 23 different
Dominican cloistered nuns.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Father Michael Monshau, O.P., Prior, Dominican House of Studies, Saint
Louis, Missouri&lt;p&gt;
&quot;These remarkable personal testimonies demonstrate the power of God&#39;s fruitful
invitation to a contemplative and cloistered life in the Dominican tradition.
Though each testimony is unique, there is a common link among them that
recalls Elizabeth&#39;s words to Mary: &#39;Blessed is she who believed that there
would be fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord (Luke 1:45).&#39;
These testimonies, then, are not a history of the past rather they give confidence
to all in the present who have the courage to accept God&#39;s invitation to Himself.
Indeed, God has done great things. This book reminds all of us that God is still
doing great things.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

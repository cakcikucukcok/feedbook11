  <title>The Search for the Perfect Whore - Raymond Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raymond Archer knows he should be back in Cincinnati paying taxes and getting stuck in traffic, but here he is in Puerto Plata with only one goal-to find the perfect whore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Carlos came by my place at 2 P.M. He was supposed to be here at 12, but you have to take in-account Dominican time. I guess you could say he was early. I knew it was going to be another day of an endless quest for whores and drink. Sex was getting like the Dr. Pepper that you needed at ten, two, and four ... I think we were both looking for the perfect whore, though our views about that differed. Perhaps in our search for the perfect whore we would find the Virgin Mother herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Archer&#39;s carousing leads him into sometimes exciting and sometimes dangerous adventures. But will he be successful in &lt;I&gt;The Search for the Perfect Whore&lt;/I&gt;?" />

  <title>Share My Soul - Yosipa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the poet Yosipa, her spiritual journey has been like that of a child jumping up and trying to touch that overhanging branch on a tree, to swipe the tips of its leaves. He or she doesnt give up, but continues to try, knowing that one day it will be possible. And then suddenly, the child is grown; he or she no longer needs to jump to reach the tree and instead can just be one with the tree and everything elseeffortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yosipas journey began twenty years ago in Sydney, Australia. Riding the bus home as a young woman, she saw a crystal shop and felt compelled to leave the bus and go inside. She did so, and found a world of discovery through self-help books. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the age of twenty-three, Yosipa moved to Byron Bay, where the inspiration and wisdom came from to write Share My Soul and to share it with the world. She presents this collection of spiritual, emotionally evocative poetry that draws you into the inner world of life, love, and discovery based upon Yosipas life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;" />

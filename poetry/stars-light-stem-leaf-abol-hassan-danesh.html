  <title>Stars Light:  Stem &amp; Leaf - Abol Hassan Danesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In close parallel with the fifth volume of stars lights theme and content, Stem and Leaf Volume, is an attempt to put the entire six volumes of stars light poetry in perspective. Perhaps a comet would be a better metaphor to capture the spirit of this volume of work in terms of its connectivity potential to the continuous &amp; long tail blazing of light from the point of its origin to that of destination. That is, a clear demarcation of territory travelled through stars light journey. In simple words, another way of looking at the milky way in heaven, is to see it as a large star comet itself in standstill with all trail light path way travelled made visible in close up. And for further elucidation of this volume may I then suggest that the stem of a leaf is itself the trunk of tree par excellence, making sure the leaf never leaves the tree despite all the falling, break away, and separation in each year and in each and every other season." />

  <title>When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self-Reliance, Sustainability, and Surviving the Long Emergency, 2nd Edition - Matthew Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s never been a better time to &amp;#8220;be prepared.&amp;#8221; Matthew Stein&amp;#8217;s comprehensive primer on sustainable living skills&amp;#8212;from food and water to shelter and energy to first-aid and crisis-management skills&amp;#8212;prepares you to embark on the path toward sustainability. But unlike any other book, Stein not only shows you how to live &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; in seemingly stable times, but to live in the face of potential disasters, lasting days or years, coming in the form of social upheaval, economic meltdown, or environmental catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Technology Fails&lt;/em&gt; covers the gamut. You&amp;#8217;ll learn how to start a fire and keep warm if you&amp;#8217;ve been left temporarily homeless, as well as the basics of installing a renewable energy system for your home or business. You&amp;#8217;ll learn how to find and sterilize water in the face of utility failure, as well as practical information for dealing with water-quality issues even when the public tap water is still flowing. You&amp;#8217;ll learn alternative techniques for healing equally suited to an era of profit-driven malpractice as to situations of social calamity. Each chapter (a survey of the risks to the status quo; supplies and preparation for short- and long-term emergencies; emergency measures for survival; water; food; shelter; clothing; first aid, low-tech medicine, and healing; energy, heat, and power; metalworking; utensils and storage; low-tech chemistry; and engineering, machines, and materials) offers the same approach, describing skills for self-reliance in good times and bad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fully revised and expanded&amp;#8212;the first edition was written pre-9/11 and pre-Katrina, when few Americans took the risk of social disruption seriously&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;When Technology Fails&lt;/em&gt; ends on a positive, proactive note with a new chapter on &quot;Making the Shift to Sustainability,&quot; which offers practical suggestions for changing our world on personal, community and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;" />

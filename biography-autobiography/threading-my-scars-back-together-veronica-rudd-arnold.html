  <title>&quot;Threading My Scars Back Together&quot; - Veronica Rudd Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Veronica Arnold and we can experience Gods purpose and fullness in every area of our life if we stay on Gods path for direction. My desire to write this book was mainly for therapy, but also to share my source of strength and security in the Lord. Phil: 4:13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.&lt;/p&gt;
In such a crazy mixed up world we are living in; with such a diversity of people, I have come to realize there are many young girls, women or men who have let tragedy and disastrous things come in and out of their lives and if somehow reading my book can help them to understand their circumstances and situations better; then I feel it would have been worth the time and effort spent in compiling my thoughts to share with others.&lt;/p&gt; 
I currently reside in Lincolnton, North Carolina in Lincoln County. I have been married for 32 years to a wonderful man named Bruce Arnold; together we had one son; Brian Arnold. I have one grand-daughter, Addison Grace Arnold who is the love of my life. I graduated from East Lincoln Sr., High School in 1974. As I traveled my journey through life; I carried such heavy burdens well within my soul from the passing of my mother and father at such a young tender age and many other things that were never worked through until I was married for 20+ years. I sought out christian counseling that helped me deal with many problems in my life and felt compelled to share with others about my childhood years growing up and it doesnt matter how indigent a family is; or how many trials a person has gone through in their life; I encourage people to look to God because He is their only hope. All that I had been through in my life; God sought me out; saved me and my life has never been the same. Im just a sinner saved by Grace." />

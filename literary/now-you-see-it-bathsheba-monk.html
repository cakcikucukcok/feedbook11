  <title>Now You See It . . . - Bathsheba Monk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s pretty much a straight shot from the upstate New York towns of Richard Russo&#39;s books to Bathsheba Monk&#39;s Cokesville, PA. This is coal and steel country. The sort of place where an inch of soot on the windowsill means a regular paycheck--and two inches means a fat one. And what&#39;s the best make-out spot in town? Next to the burning slag heap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seventeen beguiling, linked stories, spanning fourty-five years, Monk brings a corner of America alive as never before. Her world bursts with indelible characters: Mrs. Szilborski, who bakes great cake, but sprays her neighbors&#39; dogs with mace; and Mrs. Wojic, who believes her husband was reincarnated--as one of those dogs. Then there is the younger generation: Annie Kusiak , who wants to write, and Theresa Gojuk, who dreams of stardom. Cokesville is their Yoknapatawpha; they ache to escape it and the ghosts of their ancestors and the regret of their parents. What ghosts--and what regrets! When Theresa&#39;s father Bruno falls into a vat of molten steel, the mill gives the family an ingot roughly his weight to bury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As deliciously wry as Allegra Goodman in &lt;i&gt;The Family Markowitz&lt;/i&gt;, and with the matter-of-fact humanity of Grace Paley, Bathsheba Monk leads us into a world that is at once totally surprising and recognizable. These stories glow like molten steel.&lt;/p&gt;" />

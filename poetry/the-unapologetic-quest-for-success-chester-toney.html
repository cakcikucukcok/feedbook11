  <title>The Unapologetic Quest for Success - Chester Toney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two books for the price of one!  The epic story is the unvarnished truth of the life history of a rural boy of genuinely humble beginning; who survived some of the most atrocious and devious events of life struggles, including a most heinous attempt of homicide against the lives of his entire family; but who still grew up to become a medical doctor associated with international record breaking fame, thus becoming one of the most illustrious and popular icons in his country.&lt;p&gt;
The Unapologetic quest for success is a read for all; however it is the fervent wish of the author that this story will serve as an inspiration beacon for all those youths who would share similar life experiences to his.&lt;p&gt;
The book is an emotion pack reader.  Despite the authentic nature of the story the contents of its chapters are pregnant with the sort of excitements and mood swings that I am sure would keep its readers glued to its pages.  His poetic side complements the story but also brings out the deeper thoughts of the author.  A must read!

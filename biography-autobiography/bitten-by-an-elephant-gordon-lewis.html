  <title>Bitten by an Elephant - Gordon Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the age of 65 Gordon Lewis was described by an enraged senior judge as a &#39;bloody maverick!&#39; He took comfort from this assessment as he felt it confirmed that he was on the right track...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gordon Lewis loves the humanity of the Law. That affection has led him to a legal career of great diversity. Whether as Director of the Victorian Law Institute, sitting as a County Court Judge, regular presentations on radio, guest speaker at both overseas and Australian conferences, or his role as Cricket Australia&#39;s Senior Code of Conduct Commissioner, his name has become almost as well known to the general public as it is to the legal profession.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Known for his warmth, compassion and quick wit, he has devoted many years to assisting and advising young lawyers. The textbook he originally co-authored with Justice Kyrou, Handy Hints on Legal Practice, was once described as the only legal textbook to ever make the readers laugh. Several years ago he decided to write &#39;a funny book about the law and his life so far.&#39; This book is the result. Whether it is the law stripped of its pomposity, cricket, film reviewing, greyhounds or just coping with life&#39;s exigencies, the self-deprecatory humour in these pages gives a rare insight into the author&#39;s kindness and sense of fun. You might also think that apart from writing &#39;a funny book&#39;, almost coincidentally the author has recorded a testament to overcoming personal adversity." />

  <title>A Return to the ’Boro - George G. Suggs Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, the author recaptures life as he lived and observed it during the Great Depression and World War II in the small southern town of Bladenboro, North Carolina. Despite this being a troublesome era, it was the authors good fortune to grow up where families were large and strong, and people knew and respected each other. Amid segregated schools and churches and other class distinctions in those hard times, social and racial relations were peaceful. A Return to the Boro takes slices of life from this small Carolina textile town that reveal, in a small way, the caring relationships that existed among all classes at a time when the world seemed to be going to pot. It provides a glimpse of a way of life now gone. For many readers of this era, this book may provoke a trip down memory lane. If so, the author hopes that their memories will be as positive about the past as are his." />

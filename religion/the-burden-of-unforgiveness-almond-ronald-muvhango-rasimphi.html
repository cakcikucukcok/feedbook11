  <title>The Burden of Unforgiveness - Almond Ronald Muvhango Rasimphi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgivenes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: is to stop feeling angry and resentful towards someone who offended you as a result of perceiving offense, difference, or mistake or an offense or flaw. It is a process of concluding resentment, indignation or mistake, or ceasing to demand punishment or restitution. &lt;/em&gt;Henceforth - the breaking the unrelenting chains of pain that held us back from good progress and advancement.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All humans are victims of self and each others grudge bearing, revenge seeking and continued hatred at times&lt;/em&gt;. But we must know and understand that there isnt any solution, neither could grudge bearing, revenge seeking and continued hatred brings peace to self or to all humanity. We need to believe in finding a way to forgive one-self and others. &lt;em&gt;All victims of unforgiveness and negativity must believe that; t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;here is a way to be good again and to encourage one-self and others escape unforgiveness and negativity onslaught and redeem one-self and help others to be redeemed.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;We must keep peeking into that deserted alley and look forward to forgiveness and reconciliation, as well as, to always remember and know that there was brotherhood between people who had fed from the same breast, lived and worked together or shared some good experience and a kinship that even time could not break.&lt;/em&gt; We can lift our spirit from the certainty of turmoil and drop ourselves into the ocean of peace of mind. Because when spring comes it causes melting of the snow flake at a time, and maybe we will witness first hand the unforgiveness and negativity snowflake melting to the grand match of regain our peace of mind and smiles back.&lt;/p&gt;" />

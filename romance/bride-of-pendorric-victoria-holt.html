  <title>Bride of Pendorric - Victoria Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Favel Farrington meets Roc Pendorric on the idyllic Mediterranean island of Capri, where she was raised and lives with her father.  Roc sweeps her off her feet, taking her from her home by an emerald sea to the ancient family home of the Pendorrics, in Cornwall. His sister and her family await them with open arms, welcoming young Favel. She is the much anticipated Bride of Pendorric, a name that amuses and flatters her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The castle is beautiful in its way, but the atmosphere is foreboding. Roc&#39;s twin nieces begin watching her carefully; even the stones in the courtyard seem to have eyes.  On the walls hang portraits of two other Brides of Pendorric--one of them Roc&#39;s mother--who died both young and tragically. Favel&#39;s fear increases as Roc seems to be growing more and more distant. Has her courtship and marriage been just a deception? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Favel can no longer dismiss as accidents the strange things happening to her. Someone is trying to kill her and she must confront the very real dangers that surround her.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Bride of Pendorric was a nice surprise -- family secrets, paintings of unfortunate brides, twins (twins run in the Pendorric family) - including the identical pair nicknamed Hy and Lo, nieces of Favel's new husband.

  <title>The Transgender Teen - Stephanie Brill, Lisa Kenney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do you do when your son announces he is transgender and asks that you call her by a new name? Or what if your child uses a term you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of to describe themselves (neutrois, agender, non-binary, genderqueer, androgyne&amp;hellip;) and when you didn&amp;rsquo;t know what they meant, they left the room and now won&amp;rsquo;t speak to you about it? Perhaps your daughter recently asked you not to use gendered pronouns when referring to &amp;lsquo;her&amp;rsquo; anymore, preferring that you use &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo;; you&amp;rsquo;re left wondering if this is just a phase, or if there&amp;rsquo;s something more that you need to understand about your child.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; There is a generational divide in our understandings of gender. This comprehensive guidebook helps to bridge that divide by exploring the unique challenges that thousands of families face every day raising a teenager who may be transgender, non-binary, gender-fluid or otherwise gender-expansive. Combining years of experience working in the field with extensive research and personal interviews, the authors cover pressing concerns relating to physical and emotional development, social and school pressures, medical considerations, and family communications. Learn how parents can more deeply understand their children, and raise their non-binary or transgender adolescent with love and compassion." />

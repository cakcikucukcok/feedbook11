  <title>The Bee Road - Michel Strickland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At ninety-seven, Grace Campbell, a Scottish immigrant ranchers wife, has drawn strength from magic over the years; she has the gift of second sight. But now, shes been stolen away from the home she loves by her controlling son, Douglas. Even she cant see what her future holds, so she calls in the cavalry for help. Afraid and alone, Grace must now rely on her free-spirited granddaughter Georgiana to bring her back home to die. &lt;p&gt;
But Georgiana has a few demons of her own to fight before she can help Grace. &lt;p&gt;
At forty-seven, Georgiana has just managed to extricate herself from a disastrously abusive relationshipbut the price she paid for her own freedom was custody of the little stepdaughter she adores. She now questions whether life holds any meaning for her anymore, and she turns to her lost skills for comfort. She hopes that in the rediscovery of her love of pottery, she will learn to love herself again. As the restoration of her pottery studio nears completion, still wrestling with her own grief, she gets the call from her grandmother. &lt;p&gt;
On the trip home, they are dogged by Douglas, who has obtained a court order to take his mother back to California. As they fight for Graces freedom and dignity, the two women learn things about themselves and each other. They are on a journey that will change both of their lives foreverone that will test their stamina, their determination, and their ability to believe." />

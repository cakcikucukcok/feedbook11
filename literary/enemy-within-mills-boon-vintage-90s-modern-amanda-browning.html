          &lt;strong&gt;She Had to Harden Her Heart!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A troubled childhood and a disastrous love affair had left Michaela older and wiser - and vowing never to get close to anyone again. And that certainly included photographer Ryan Douglas with his legendary reputation as a womanizer!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan was determined to believe that Mickey had encouraged her half sister to run off with his wealthy nephew - and he was going to make Mickey pay the price by demanding that she join his search for the missing pair.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan was Mickey&#39;s enemy: he had the power to threaten the whole fabric of her life - and even if she wasn&#39;t able to avoid being with him, she could refuse to fall in love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Author Sam Quinones published the book Dreamland: The True Tale of America&amp;#39;s Opiate Epidemic in 2015. Quinones writes about the shocking and explosive account of addiction in America. It was 1929 in Portsmouth, Ohio. A company built a community swimming pool that was the size of a football field. It became the heart of the community. They named it Dreamland. Now, addiction has plagued Portsmouth, like it did to other small towns. How this happened is the story Quinones tells in his book Dreamland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marc Maron loves this book and describes it as a &amp;ldquo;stunning journalistic journey that follows the history and narrative trajectories that lead to this entirely new style of cultivating drug addiction.&amp;rdquo; San Francisco Chronicle Book Review says that Quinones is &amp;ldquo;the most original writer on Mexico and the border.&amp;rdquo; Booklist gave Dreamland a starred review and remarked, &amp;ldquo;Quinones weaves an extraordinary story.&amp;rdquo; Entertainment Weekly rated the book A- and says, &amp;ldquo;there is something legitimately interesting (and frequently horrifying) on every page.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
???????&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;

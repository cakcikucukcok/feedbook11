  <title>The Secret Book of Paradys - Tanith Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The strange and the tormented dwell in Paradys--prowling its dark streets and twisted alleyways, passing the endless hours in the city&#39;s elegant mansions and smoke-tarnished inns, wandering in moldering graveyards and the stark surrounding countryside. For the land here is bound by a timeless, soul-chilling magic, and that power has cast its spell over all who have ever lived in this foreboding and dangerous place. All who came to Paradys were forever touched by its dread magic. The City was not one place but three, bound together by a labyrinth of ice yet separated, perhaps by time, perhaps by some long-forgotten enchantment, into Paradise, Paradis and Paradys--each cursed in an entirely different way... Witness the city of Paradys&#39; life and history through the eyes of its provocative and perverse citizens--a darkly fascinating odyssey as only World Fantasy Award winner Tanith Lee could imagine it.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

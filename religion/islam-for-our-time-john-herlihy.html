  <title>Islam for Our Time - John Herlihy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written by an American Muslim convert who has lived nearly 40 years among the Muslims, the author presents an insiders account of Islams true place within the family of religions, what it means to be a Muslim living in the shadow of the modern world, and how to cultivate a life of spirituality through the way of Islam in todays anti-spiritual environment. Within its pages, history unfolds, mysteries are unveiled, and secrets are revealed that shed light on the great human story of spiritual awakening and fulfillment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This rigorous and highly readable introduction to Islam goes a long way to remedy the lack of historical perspective and the narrowing of intellectual and spiritual scope contributing to the outer and inner crisis of the Muslim world, as well as the poor understanding of this religion in the West.  Another significant merit of Herlihys book is the way it sets out the universal principles of Islam, shared with other traditional faiths, and its emphasis on the moral and spiritual fruits of the religion.  This work is an invaluable resource for Muslims and non-Muslims alike, providing as it does a solid grounding in the traditional spirit of Islam.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Patrick Laude&lt;/b&gt;, professor at Georgetown University, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Qatar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Readers will find that this timely work by John Herlihy offers a sublime contribution to the field of Islamic Studies. Relevant for Muslims and non-Muslims alike, one of the books major themes is that the Islamic tradition converges with the unanimous tradition residing at the heart of each of the worlds religions. The book reminds us that the foundations of the modern and postmodern world were formulated in revolt from the sacred, which is an essential point to be recognized by anyone seeking to understand the crisis that consumes the contemporary epoch. This work provides ultimate answers to ultimate questions.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Samuel Bendeck Sotillos&lt;/b&gt;, editor of &lt;i&gt;Psychology and the Perennial Philosophy: Studies in Comparative Religion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Amidst widespread miscomprehensions of Islam generated by Western media, readers who wish to understand the true nature of this noble tradition and its related spirituality will find this volume a trustworthy and illuminating guide. As a Western convert, philosopher, and above all practitioner, John Herlihy is well placed to dispel the fog of misunderstanding which often surrounds the subject of Islam. This book will be warmly welcomed by all those wishing to understand the timeless message of Islam, by seekers looking for practical guidance, and by those concerned with fostering a more harmonious global community of religions.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Harry Oldmeadow&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;Frithjof Schuon and the Perennial Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;." />

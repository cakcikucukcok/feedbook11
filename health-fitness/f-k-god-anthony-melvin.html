  <title>F**K God? - Anthony Melvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While growing up, Anthony has seen and had many conversations and encounters with angels, spirits, and with God. As a kid, while drowning, he had an angel appear to him underwater and comforted him. The spirit of his mothers deceased friend helped him when he was injured after falling off his bike. As a lost kid at the Sears mall, his deceased grandmother manifested herself to help him. His best friend who died in a car accident visited him in the middle of the night to let him know that he was okay in the spirit realm. 
Anthony is a former drug dealer, car thief and has slept with hundreds of women. He was a nonbeliever and ignorant to the Bible, faith, and Jesus. He continuously cursed God and threw many f-bombs at Jesus. He even went out of his way to critique and mock other believers. Even though he witnessed many supernatural occurrences and miracles happening in and around his life, he never associated those events or experiences with God. Then one day, God put him in a position where he would have no choice but to cry out to Him. 
This powerful book is the story of one mans journey with God and the unseen spiritual realm that surrounds us daily." />

  <title>Talking to Ourselves - Andrés Neuman, Nick Caistor, Lorenza Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A searing family drama from one of Latin America&#39;s most original voices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One trip. Two love stories. Three voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lito is ten years old and is almost sure he can change the weather when he concentrates very hard. His father, Mario, anxious to create a memory that will last for his son&#39;s lifetime, takes him on a road trip in a truck called Pedro. But Lito doesn&#39;t know that this might be their last trip: Mario is gravely ill. Together, father and son embark on a journey takes them through strange geographies that seem to meld the different parts of the Spanish-speaking world. In the meantime, Lito&#39;s mother, Elena, restlessly seeks support in books, and soon undertakes an adventure of her own that will challenge her moral limits. Each narrative--of father, son, and mother--embodies one of the different ways that we talk to ourselves: through speech, through thought, and through writing. While neither of them dares to tell the complete truth to the other two, their individual voices nonetheless form a poignant conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, we all face loss. Andrés Neuman movingly narrates the ways the lives of those who survive loss are transformed; how that experience changes our ideas about time, memory, and our own bodies; and how the acts of reading, and of sex, can serve as powerful modes of resistance. &lt;i&gt;Talking to Ourselves&lt;/i&gt; presents a tender yet unsentimental portrait of the workings of love and family; a reflection both on grief and on the consolation of words. Neuman, the author of the award-winning &lt;i&gt;Traveler of the Century&lt;/i&gt;, displays his characteristic warmth, bittersweet humor, and wide-ranging intellect, giving us the rich, textured, and strikingly different voices and experiences of three singular characters while presenting, above all, a profound tribute to those who have ever had to care for a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Woman on Purpose - Bola Adepoju</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every woman has a destiny already concluded in Gods plan.  It does not matter where or how you started, there is a plan and purpose of God for you.  You were created purposely as a woman and you have deposited in you unique and divine abilities.  You are a walking miracle going somewhere to happen.  
You will meet women who have gone ahead of you and are telling you what they have learned.  You will learn that:
X	You were created on purpose, for a purpose and by purpose.
X	Your past is no barrier to your future unless you make it.
X	You are created to make a difference.
X	Your impossibility is Gods opportunity for your lifting.
X	Failure is not your enemy.  You can learn from it.
X	Never give up on yourself or your dreams.
It is the Spirit of God that was breathed into man at creation that sets him/her apart from all other creations.  It is that Spirit that causes you as a woman to want to strive for excellence.  It is that Spirit upon you that should make you want to be a pacesetter or trailblazer and not a follower.  It is that Spirit in you that compels you to make a difference wherever you go or in whatever you do.  It is that spirit that wants you to keep getting up even though you may have fallen several times.  It is that Spirit that will not allow you to accept defeat or failure.  It will not allow you to accept the status quo.  It is that Spirit that allows you to press on even when you dont feel like it.  It is that spirit that makes you ask the question, Why am I here?  Why did God create me?  Why did He create me a woman?  He created me a woman and I know He did it for a reason.  What can I do in my home, work place, church, community, etc. to make a difference?   I know I have my limitations, but one thing I am sure of is that the word of God is true.  I believe His word that says, I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me (Philippians 4:13).
We are not all called to be pastors or bishops, but we have all been called to make a difference.  You are a woman on purpose.  It is that call that makes you as a woman on purpose to know that you have been called to be more than this.  God has put before the woman a large field, His field.  His field in your life is your territory for expansion and to fulfill Gods plan for your life. His field in your life is your children, husband, career, ministry and all the Lord has put in your life.  His field is large and is ripe for harvest and He has called you to harvest it!!" />

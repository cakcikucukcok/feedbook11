  <title>Mike Bond Bound - Mike Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="www.mikebondbooks.com   MIKE BOND BOUND is the e-Book bundling of three Mike Bond thrillers: HOLY WAR - HOUSE OF JAGUAR - THE LAST SAVANNA   HOUSE OF JAGUAR   The Battle of Beirut is worse than Hell, an irrational maelstrom of implacable hatreds and inconceivable suffering, of screaming bombs and exploding shells, crashing buildings, sniper battles, and deadly ambushes. Neill, a war correspondent on a secret mission for Britain&#39;s MI6 intelligence agency, is trying to find Mohammed, a Hezbollah terrorist leader who may be willing to stop the slaughter and destruction.   André, a French commando, is also looking for Mohammed, to kill him in revenge for the death of his brother, blown up with over 400 US Marines and French paratroopers by Hezbollah. For Rosa, a remorseless and passionate Palestinian guerrilla, Mohammed is one of the few hopes left for her people, and she will give her life to protect him. And for lovely Anne-Marie, André is the only one who can rescue her from Hell.   Based on Bond&#39;s own experiences in Lebanon, Syria and the Middle East, Holy War has been praised for its portrayal of battle and its journalistic and political realism, and for its evocative descriptions of men and women caught in a deadly crossfire.   &quot;Bond does it again - A gripping tale of passion, hostage-taking and war, set against a war-ravaged Beirut.&quot; ? Evening News   &quot;A profound tale of war...Literally impossible to stop reading.&quot; ? British Armed Forces Broadcasting   HOUSE OF JAGUAR   Shot down over the jungle with a planeload of marijuana, Vietnam War hero Joe Murphy gets caught up in the brutal Guatemalan Civil War when he witnesses an attack on a Mayan village by the Guatemalan Army and its CIA &quot;advisors&quot;. Badly injured, he escapes on a nightmare trek through the jungle, hunted by the Army, the CIA, and death squads.   Healed by guerrilla doctor Dona Villalobos, he falls in love with her and tries to save her from the War&#39;s widening horror of insanity, tragedy, and death. Caught in the crucible of violence and love, he learns the peaks and depths the human heart can reach, and what humans will do for, and to,each other.   Based on the author&#39;s own experiences as one of the last foreign correspondents left alive in Guatemala after over 100 journalists had been killed by Army death squads.    THE LAST SAVANNA   With Africa&#39;s last elephants dying under the poachers&#39; guns, Kenya rancher and former SAS officer Ian MacAdam leads a commando squad against them. Pursuing the poachers through jungled mountains and searing deserts he battles thirst, solitude, terror and lethal animals, only to find that the poachers have kidnapped a young archaeologist, Rebecca Hecht, whom he once loved and bitterly lost. McAdam embarks upon a desperate trek to save not only Rebecca but his own soul in an Africa torn apart by wars, overpopulation, and the slaughter of its last wildlife. Based on the author&#39;s experiences pursuing elephant poachers in the wilds of East Africa.   &quot;Mike Bond&#39;s THE LAST SAVANNA is shot through with images of the natural world at its most fearsome and most merciful. With his weapons, man is a conqueror - without them he is a fugitive in an alien land. Bond touches on the vast and eerie depths that lie under the thin crust of civilization and the base instinct within man to survive - instincts that surpass materialism. A thoroughly enjoyable read that comes highly recommended.&quot; (Nottingham Observer)   MIKE BOND BIOGRAPHY   Bestselling author, advisor to the US and foreign governments, human rights and war correspondent, award-winning poet and international energy expert, Mike Bond has lived and worked in over thirty countries on six continents. His works have been translated into many languages and have been praised by critics on both sides of the Atlantic for their intricate plots, fascinating characters, extraordinary settings, and explosive pace." />

  <title>Disband the Corrupt Federal Reserve System and the Irs Now! - Pete Sotos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Local and international bankers gathered on Jekyll Island in November 1910 for a secret meeting that would have lasting consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil men drafted illegal legislation to control our entire banking system and economy. They also schemed to force every citizen to pay income taxes or face incarceration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Sotos, a financial expert, reveals the names of the people to blame, as well as places and dates. He answers critical questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why were the Federal Reserve System and the Internal 	 
	Revenue Service created in the same year?
Why should we demand that the Federal Reserve System and 
	the IRS be disbanded?
How could we get the money we need under a new system?
 What can we learn from what past figures have said about 
	money and taxes?
&lt;p&gt;Corrupt legislators continue to close tax loopholes every single yearincreasing the tax burden for hard working Americans everywhere. What theyre doing is illegal and wrong, which is why we must &lt;i&gt;Disband the Corrupt Federal Reserve System and the IRS NOW!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

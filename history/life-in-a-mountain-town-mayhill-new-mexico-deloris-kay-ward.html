  <title>Life in a Mountain Town ‘Mayhill, New Mexico’ - Deloris Kay Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The memories of a by-gone era of a town full of loving Christian people. The good and wonderful times and the hard and sad times of the 40s and the depression era when it was a tough struggle to line. The story continues into the 50s and 60s when times were somewhat better. 
It was also a time when there were good morals and most all of America believed in god and trusted in Him, and showed their love and devotion to God and their neighbors where a hand shake was their contract. 
Children were taught to mind and had to suffer the consequences of a bad behavior, and they were made to work the same as adults if they expected to eat. We were not abused but taught how to survive in a tough world. 
There were days of laughter and days for tears that close family and friends shared, and the ways that children entertained themselves in the days of no television, and not much in the way of toys. 
Some call them the good ole days and others call it down and out hard times, but whatever those days were to others they are embedded in a mountain girls memories as something wonderful to remember, cherish, and share." />

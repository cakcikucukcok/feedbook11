  <title>FLOWER CHILDREN - an illustrated children&#39;s book about flowers - Elizabeth Gordon, Illustrated by M.T. Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prepared by Elizabeth&amp;#39; Gordon and illustrated by M.T. Ross you can use this excellent little book to teach your children the names of over 80 flowers which can be found in local gardens throughout the year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains over 80 color illustrations of cherubs draped in the petals and foliage of the flower to make them more fun to learn. Each is accompanied by a catchy 4 line rhyme which tells children of what to look for to identify the flower and what time of year they should be looking for them. Herein you will find flowers like Crocus, Trailing Arbutus, Daffodils, Hyacinth, Tulip, Lily-Of-The-Valley, Dandelion, wind-flower, Trillium, Pansies and a host more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A flower, a child, and a mother&amp;rsquo;s heart&amp;mdash;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;These three are never so far apart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A child, a flower, and a mother&amp;rsquo;s love&amp;mdash;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This world&amp;rsquo;s best gifts from the world above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In preparing this book the author and the artist have attempted to show the kinship of children and flowers&amp;mdash;and it is their hope that the little ones into whose hands this volume comes will find herein the proof that their knowledge of what flowers really are is true and that their love for the friendly blossoms is returned many-fold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ALL children are flowers in the garden of God&amp;rsquo;s love. A flower is the mystical counterpart of a child. To the understanding heart a child is a flower and a flower is a child. God made flowers on the day that He made the world beautiful. Then He gave the world children to play amid the flowers. God has implanted in the breasts of children a natural love for flowers&amp;mdash;and no one who keeps that love in his heart has entirely forsaken the land of childhood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To you, then, little child-flowers, this book is lovingly offered as an expression of thankfulness to children for the joy and sweetness with which they have filled my life.&lt;br /&gt;

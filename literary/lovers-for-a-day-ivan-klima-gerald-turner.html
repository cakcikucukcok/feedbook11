  <title>Lovers for a Day - Ivan Klima, Gerald Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Ivan Klima has been called a &quot;Czech genius&quot; by the Los Angeles Times Book Review. In these stories spanning his long career from the 1960s to the present, he gives us a gallery of people searching, in love, for escape: factory girls on their day off and assembly-line workers lost in Walter-Mittyesque fantasies; a young woman on a honeymoon with the man she did not marry; a divorce-court judge whose mistress cannot understand his affection for the routines of his marriage; a young wife who falls into a passionate affair with an elderly bookbinder crippled by war. Lovers for a Day is a book stamped with Klima&#39;s unique wisdom, a personal history of a national evolution and an acute and moving examination of our attempts to find freedom in love. &quot;Ivan Klima&#39;s view of love is often witty, sometimes playful, and has a convincing sense of the erotic....[and] the kindness that can endure between a husband and wife long after the passion has fled.&quot; -- Andrew Miller, The New York Times Book Review; &quot;Klima has evolved differently from his contemporaries.... Rather than become embittered by his country&#39;s past, Klima has come to a truce with imperfection -- the imperfection of history and of love.&quot; -- Jennie Yabroff, San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Yesterday - Felicia Yap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do you solve a murder when you can only remember yesterday? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Imagine a world in which classes are divided not by wealth or religion but by how much each group can remember. Monos, the majority, have only one day&#39;s worth of memory; elite Duos have two. In this stratified society, where Monos are excluded from holding high office and demanding jobs, Claire and Mark are a rare mixed marriage. Clare is a conscientious Mono housewife, Mark a novelist-turned-politician Duo on the rise. They are a shining example of a new vision of tolerance and equality-until... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A beautiful woman is found dead, her body dumped in England&#39;s River Cam. The woman is Mark&#39;s mistress, and he is the prime suspect in her murder. The detective investigating the case has secrets of his own. So did the victim. And when both the investigator&#39;s and the suspect&#39;s memories are constantly erased -- how can anyone learn the truth? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Told from four different perspectives, that of Mark, Claire, the detective on the case, and the victim -- Felicia Yap&#39;s staggeringly inventive debut leads us on a race against an ever-resetting clock to find the killer. With the science-fiction world-building of Philip K. Dick and the twisted ingenuity of &lt;i&gt;Memento, Yesterday&lt;/i&gt; is a thriller you&#39;ll never forget." />

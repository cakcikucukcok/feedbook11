  <title>Ministry in Tears - Rev. Benjamin A Vima, Rev. Dasan V Vima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, the two priest brothers portray the tears they shed in priestly ministry, not merely to ventilate their emotional outbursts or confessions to their friends, kith and kins, and even their so-called enemies, but most of all, to celebrate those tears as part of the blessing that has come to strengthen their union with the Lord, with the church, and certainly with their lifelong neighbors. The kind of tears their eyes showered were those of gratitude, joy, and sorrow. Their discussion also would bring home to every good-willed people how the foreign-born priests who serve the church in different continents not to be considered as mere international priests in a modern business term, rather to be esteemed as the true missionaries sent by the Lord for the impending purpose of new evangelization. Ultimately, their dream in this dialogical venture is to bring their readers, especially their (international) fellow missionary priests, closer to Jesus, the one they love the most, and to the church, his beloved spouse." />

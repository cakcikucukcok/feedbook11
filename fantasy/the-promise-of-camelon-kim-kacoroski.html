  <title>The Promise of Camelon - Kim Kacoroski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The legend of Camelot is one of the most widely known, and perennially mistold, of all lore. Now, author Kim Kacoroski&amp;rsquo;s lighthearted look at the beloved tale dispels the wealth of erroneous retelling in The Promise of Camelon, Kacoroski&amp;rsquo;s beguilingly personable approach to historical fiction. With humor, history, and a thoroughly engaging conviviality, this illuminating book is certain to appeal to adults and young adults with a curiosity for the true version of the magical kingdom and its transcendent court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the book takes off, we meet the last of the Arctos civilization, which has been all but decimated by the Serpentine Federation, a vampire-like breed who have long lost their souls and spirits and can only propagate by latching onto other forms of life. To do so, they have taken over a school of children, who are being used for hybrid experiments. One child, Alwyn, escapes to find refuge with Arctos survivors. However, a tracking crystal embedded is his brain ensures he will be forever pursued by his tormentors, who will savage villages to get him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this perilous set of circumstances emerge our two main characters, Merilyn, an infant son of a mermaid with wizardly ways, and Arcas, the heir to the Camelon kingdom. As the two come together in fierce friendship and full-on adventure, all roads lead to Calibur, the famed sword lodged in stone that will vouchsafe the kingdom to its successful extractor. Along the way, Arcas connects with renowned Arthurian players, like the Lady of the Lake, advancing in age and ambition to lay claim to his rightful throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heady, happy, and true to the details of the Camelot story, The Promise of Camelon offers a whimsical, fantastical foray into regal and warring realms that will enthrall anyone with a penchant for legends, a bit of wanderlust, and an admiration for getting a sensational, timeless story right. It&amp;rsquo;s a must for adults and young adults who are game for a great read and a rollicking good time.&lt;/p&gt;" />

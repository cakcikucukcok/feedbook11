  <title>Truth Is, You&#39;re Still Dreaming - Matthew L. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s face it, being a teenager is hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school is depressing, your mother&#39;s overbearing, the only friend you have in your new school doesn&#39;t have any time for you, and your therapist wont get off your back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yeah, you might have narcolepsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great start to your sophomore year, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Daniel wants to leave the past alone, but his inner demons keep him up at night. When theyre not keeping him up, though, he is dead asleep in all his classes and dreaming. Wild dreams. Fantastic even! Are they nonsense? Are they memories? Hell have to stop running from them to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth Is, Youre Still Dreaming is a novel for young adults about that time in ones life where being a grown up seems both imminent and a lifetime away.&lt;/p&gt;" />

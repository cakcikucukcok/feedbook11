  <title>Near Dracula&#39;s Castle - Patrick Vaitus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Laura Williams believes in the magic of song. Shes a famous Canadian pop singer, and she feels most alive onstage. Theres something otherworldly about being beneath the bright lights in front of an adoring audience. It truly is magicalas is her newly received invitation to study with a coven of witches in Romania. Laura is skeptical, but that doesnt mean she turns down their offer; soon, shes on a plane crossing the sea.
Her teachers believe Laura to be a gifted witch. As she performs her first incantations, their beliefs are solidified by her uncanny natural ability. Lauras teachers are impressed, but they are also concerned. Their new pupil seems to fit very well in Romania, and her magic is very powerful. Perhaps she was Romanian in a past life; perhaps she lived and died on foreign soil.
It becomes apparent Laura does have a very real connection to Romania. It appears she is the reincarnated soul of Draculas wife, and her presence in his home country awakens something bloodthirsty from the hallowed ground. Not even the skilled Romanian witches can quench the thirst of this monster, and soon Laura must use every ounce of skill to save the world from an evil vampire prince." />

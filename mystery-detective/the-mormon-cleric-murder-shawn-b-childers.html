  <title>The Mormon Cleric Murder - Shawn B. Childers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In an Indianapolis suburb, a high-level official in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (aka, Mormon Church) has been found murdered.  Detective James Creekbaum, not being a Mormon himself and finding that the Latter-day Saints seem to have their own peculiar culture and language, encounters some confusion as he begins investigating the case.  Enter Alan Marrett, a Latter-day Saint financial analyst, who gets paired with the non-Mormon detective.  Creekbaum takes the  opportunity to ask and receive answers to many of the more commonly-asked questions about the Mormon Church and its teachings as the two pursue their investigation, a hunt that eventually puts them on the trail of an enigmatic killer who, calling himself Kishkumen, has killed once and may kill again, his next target being the prophet and worldwide leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The author is a lifelong, practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  If you are seeking accurate and correct information regarding the practices and teachings of said church in casual, non-threatening language, the author promises that buying this book will not bring the Mormon missionaries knocking on your door.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>All the Dead Yale Men: A Novel - Craig Nova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Originally published in 1982 to wide acclaim, &lt;I&gt;The Good Son&lt;/I&gt; remains Craig Nova&amp;#8217;s undisputed masterpiece. This classic explored the complicated entanglements of fathers and sons &amp;#151;expressed in the story of nouvue-riche father Pop Mackinnon, who used his wealth to manipulate his son Chip into the &amp;#145;right&amp;#8217; kind of marriage upon the young man&amp;#8217;s return from World War II.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chip eventually gave up the love of his life and married to secure his future &amp;#150; and what were the consequences of that decision? &lt;I&gt;All the Dead Yale Men&lt;/I&gt; answers that question in telling the story of Frank Mackinnon, son of Chip, a prosecutor in Boston with a happy marriage and a daughter set to follow his footsteps into law school. Chip&amp;#8217;s death throws Frank into his family&amp;#8217;s legacy, where he must contend with the inheritance of the Mackinnon&amp;#8217;s beloved land and a bevy of secrets that dates back three generations. And when Frank&amp;#8217;s daughter Pia falls under the sway of local bad boy Aurlon Miller, his grief over his father&amp;#8217;s death triggers the family legacy of social standing and manipulation to begin anew, leading Frank to the darkest edges of what a father will do to protect the ones he loves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;All the Dead Yale Men&lt;/I&gt; examines the end of an era, how privilege and inheritance often crumble in the face of the modern world, a story enriched by the setting and mythology of Boston and its surroundings. The novel not only moves the Mackinnon&amp;#8217;s story forward but will recast historical elements of the classic novel as well, heralding the arrival of a new American classic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

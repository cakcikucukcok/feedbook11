  <title>Politicuffs - Keith Berkner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I realized that only one in five Americans understood that deficits had decreased under President Barack Obama, I knew that it was time to write Politicuffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear Republicans say that 93 million Americans are wanting to work, but cant find a job, I knew that it was time to write Politicuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hear Republicans talk as if they now should be trusted with the US economy and American foreign policy, given their historical, verifiable record, I realize how timely Politicuffs is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a time needed for a one-stop source to be written on the political issues and comparable economic data of our day, it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a source needed to counter most of the Republican spin and misinformation, this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel confident that Politicuffs gives you the verifiable, definitive data and sources to counter the endless spin and misinformation provided by the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;" />

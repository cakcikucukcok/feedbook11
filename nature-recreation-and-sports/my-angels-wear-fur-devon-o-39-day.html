  <title>My Angels Wear Fur - Devon O&#39;Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over the years, animal rescue and adoption have transformed my life over and over and over,&quot; says author Devon O&#39;Day. In &lt;i&gt;My Angels Wear Fur&lt;/i&gt;, her first collection of stories that chronicle the many animals she has rescued, Devon O&#39;Day tells readers about:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tennessee Tess: A stray dog delivered to her front door by a man working on a construction crew in the neighborhood and who ended up living the glamorous life in Hollywood with O&#39;Day&#39;s sister, actress Faith Ford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Boxer of Mercy: A brindle boxer who delivers dogs in need to O&#39;Day&#39;s front door. As soon as he knows the other dog is in good hands, the boxer disappears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 30 well-written stories will warm your heart and make you understand what O&#39;Day means when she says, &quot;There is a God-like quality in animals. They love without judgment. They are loyal and caring and they see through each of us...to the hidden souls of our real beings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Mermaid Beside the Stream - Stephen David Eteng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mermaid beside the Stream is a philosophical fiction that depicts an uncommon characteristic of a fledgling entity too soon given to the pursuit of independence. It is a tale about a stripling who desires to be allowed to do things on his own at an age when most children are still totally dependent on their mothers for everything, including blowing their noses. 
The young one finally got what he was looking foran opportunity to enjoy a couple of hours of freedom free of adult monitoring. But as almost always happens albeit in disparate forms and shapes to those stubbornly striving for yet unattainable heights, he would encounter a mermaid beside the stream, a terror-inflicting meeting that complicated his world and doomed him and his relatives and friends to a lifetime of adversity.
It seeks to look in-depth into family values, the troubles faced by parents in the upbringing of children; it exposes the mistake inherent in the modern trend of not whipping children when they go astray, with an underlying criticism of embracing the white mans culture at the expense of pure tradition handed down by our African forefathers. 
It exposes the debilitating effects of fear and seeks to educate and liberate those who have allowed themselves to be shackled by it. 
This book will appeal to all classes for, like the stages of life, it unfolds with bloodcurdling suspenselife from cradle to early adulthood, with each stage underscored by lively original poetry." />

Bobby begs McCabe to return to the New York City crime beat he&amp;#8217;d left behind so many years ago, to work his old connections, and to help find Zoe before her time runs out. The stakes for McCabe and Savage have never been higher. Or more personal. And suddenly the race is on to stop a vicious attacker, before the McCabe family is torn apart beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;" />

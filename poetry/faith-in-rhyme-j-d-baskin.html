  <title>Faith in Rhyme - J. D. Baskin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Faith In Rhyme - (Unbounded), is the third in a series of Faith in Rhyme books written by author and poet J.D. Baskin. This book contains poems ranging in subject matter, from Gods love to patriotism to Biblical personages to nature. Each poem tells a story; whether based upon headline news, stories from the bible, people or occurrences personally known to the author, or simply the authors imagination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will keenly feel the authors great faith in God and his desire to share the strength he finds in his Lord. The clear and honest style expressed by the author, will appeal to readers of all ages and will inspire them to spend time daily, reflecting on Gods grace and goodness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The books subtitle of Unbounded indicates that unlike the first two books, this book is not set apart in sections of topical verse; but, it may also take on a greater meaning to individual readers. It is the authors belief that faith should truly be Unbounded. And it is his hope that as you read, you will enjoy and be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;" />

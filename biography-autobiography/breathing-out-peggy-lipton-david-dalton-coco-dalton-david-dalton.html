  <title>Breathing Out - Peggy Lipton, David Dalton, Coco Dalton, David Dalton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peggy Lipton&#39;s overnight success as Julie Barnes on television&#39;s hit &lt;i&gt;The Mod Squad&lt;/i&gt; made her an instant fashion icon and the &quot;it&quot; girl everyone-from Elvis to Paul McCartney-wanted to date. She was the original and ultimate California girl of the early seventies, complete with stick-straight hair, a laid-back style, and a red convertible. But Lipton was much more: smart and determined to not be just another leggy blonde, she struggled for a way to stay connected to her childhood roots, though her coming of age had not been an easy one. And when she fell in love with Quincy Jones, that wasn&#39;t easy, either: their biracial marriage made headlines and changed her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipton&#39;s passionate and complicated seventeen-year marriage to Jones plunged her into motherhood and also into periods of confusion and difficulty. Her struggle to keep moving forward in the world while maintaining a rich inner life informed many of her decisions as an adult. When Lipton&#39;s marriage to Jones ended, she returned to television, appearing in David Lynch&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/i&gt; as well as in &lt;i&gt;The Vagina Monologues&lt;/i&gt; and other stage productions. But her most recent triumph has been her overcoming a surprising diagnosis of colon cancer in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Breathing Out&lt;/i&gt; is full of fresh stories of life with the pop culture icons of our times, but is also a much more thoughtful book about life in the limelight, work, motherhood, and marriage. It&#39;s a refreshing and real look at the life of an actress who became, in many senses, a woman of her times.&lt;/p&gt;" />

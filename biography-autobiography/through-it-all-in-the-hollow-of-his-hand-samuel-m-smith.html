  <title>Through It All in the Hollow of His Hand - Samuel M. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through It All, IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; the real-life story of dangers, great and small, that author Samuel M. Smith faced but through which he was protected by the hand of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bible college student on summer break in 1955, he was attacked by his father in the middle of the night. His mother was already killed and everyone including Samuel, believed his father had done it because he was being unfaithful. Why did he attack Samuel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first of five life-threatening personal attacks he suffered. Then, stabbed, 1969, by someone he helped and still has the scar. He was also protected from a teenage gang, with tire irons 1969 for getting a friend to go to church, and gunpoint robberies, 1968, while taxicab driving in Chicago and gunpoint robbery, 1984, while taxicab driving in Honolulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has done short-term missionary work in the Philippines; T&#39;bilisi, Republic of Georgia, and Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has written over 100 Total Gospel tract titles  some translated in up to eleven languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Married to Virginia Quilates, from the Philippines, they have four sons, three of whom are preteen. Through it all, he has been in the hollow of Gods hand! It has been a truly exciting adventure learning to lean on Jesus and trust Him completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mission, to publish the gospel, as Jesus Christ and His original Apostles would preach and teach today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

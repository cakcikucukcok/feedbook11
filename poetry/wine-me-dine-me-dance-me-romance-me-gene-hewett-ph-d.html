  <title>Wine Me, Dine Me, Dance Me, Romance Me - Gene Hewett Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Wine Me, Dine Me, Dance Me, Romance Me,&lt;/span&gt; reads like an evolving&lt;br /&gt;collage of romantic experiences framed in poetic style. In many ways, the&lt;br /&gt;collection represents an autobiographical sketch in romance. It begins by&lt;br /&gt;providing snapshots of the authors early relationships, evolves to romantic&lt;br /&gt;accounts as viewed through the eyes of a fictional son, and concludes with&lt;br /&gt;romantic descriptions provided by that sons daughter. The collection has&lt;br /&gt;a traditional table of contents, a second one titled, Musical Inspiration,&lt;br /&gt;and a third titled, Photographic Images.&lt;br /&gt;The second table of contents illustrates the authors desire to match&lt;br /&gt;specific majority rhythm and blues songs such as Aint No Way, to each&lt;br /&gt;poem. In the short run, the author envisions that the collection will be made&lt;br /&gt;available (a) in electronic form, (b) as a paperback, and (c) for hardcover&lt;br /&gt;distribution. In addition, owing to the musical theme, the author anticipates&lt;br /&gt;that the collection can be presented in audio book form. In the long run,&lt;br /&gt;the author anticipates that it may be possible to package the collection in a&lt;br /&gt;stage production format (complete with a speaker, background music, and&lt;br /&gt;Power Point imageswith optional dance choreography).&lt;br /&gt;The third table of contents shows the authors ability to enhance the&lt;br /&gt;spirit and mood of each poem by linking them to a digital image obtained&lt;br /&gt;from the corbisimage.com website. The majority of the digital images&lt;br /&gt;were based upon floral themes such as Close-Up View of a Pink Rose,&lt;br /&gt;and landscape themes such as Wildflowers at Malibu Beach. Several&lt;br /&gt;digital image selections such as Glass of Wine with Cork and Rosebuds,&lt;br /&gt;departed from the floral/landscape pattern in order to further highlight a&lt;br /&gt;unique mood.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Sarah’S Haiku - Sarah Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I started writing these poems in May 2016 as a way of distilling issues I often think about. I was seeking clarity of thought in preparation for visits with a therapist. Some poems are memories. Some are issues I struggle with in my life. Some are lessons I need to learn. Some are moments I want to hold dear.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonreaders can read and understand the poems because they are simple and very clear. Even rereading is pleasurable, in the same way its enjoyable to play a piano piece learned many years ago. The issues are timeless for people of all ages. Hopefully, a reader will be reminded of a similar experience in his or her life. These are topics of the human condition as seen from a lifetime of experiences of joy, sadness, lessons to be learned, and lessons to share. It incorporates mindfulness and meditation and encourages peace of mind, personal growth, and honesty.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book represents courage to look at reality without pressure for perfection and with hope for being your best and brightest each day.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>Delusions, Etc. - John Berryman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mr. Berryman&#39;s posthumous book of poems, &lt;i&gt;Delusions, Etc., &lt;/i&gt;had been completed and was in proof before his death on January 7, 1972. The opening section, &quot;Opus Dei,&quot; is a sequence of eight poems based on the offices of the day from Lauds to Compline--the lines above being quoted from Nones. Part two consists of five poems whose subject are George Washington (&quot;Rectitude, and the terrible upstanding member&quot;), Beethoven, Emily Dickinson, Georg Trakl, and Dylan Thomas. The thirteen poems in the third part include &quot;Gislebertus&#39; Eve,&quot; &quot;Scholars at the Orchid Pavilion,&quot; &quot;Ecce Homo,&quot; Tampa Stomp,&quot; and &quot;Hel&lt;i&gt;lo.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; The fourth part is arranged as a scherzo. It starts with &quot;Navajo Setting the Record Straight&quot; and ends with &quot;Damn You, Jim D., You Woke Me Up.&quot; The concluding section is reflective and meditative in tone, with &quot;The Prayer of the Middle-Aged Man,&quot; &quot;Somber Prayer,&quot; &quot;Minnesota Thanksgiving,&quot; and &quot;A Usual Prayer,&quot; and a coda that rises to the high spirits of &quot;King David Dances.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Delusions, Etc. &lt;/i&gt;is an impressive collection of verse by one of the most original poets of our time, whose death at the height of his powers is a tragic loss to letters.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Bright Life - Jen Wise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life takes it out of you. But the reset you&amp;rsquo;ve been desperate for is within reach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writer and Bible teacher Jen Wise knew that holistic faith&amp;mdash;that reaches into every facet of life&amp;mdash;is what brings grace and renewal. But she didn&amp;rsquo;t begin to live this truth until her world fractured. So as she searched Scripture for a better way, she discovered Jesus&amp;rsquo; invitation for just that: small steps able to lead us into a bright new beginning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to the woman who feels her all is never enough, &lt;em&gt;The Bright Life&lt;/em&gt; is your invitation to a new start. You were created to be healthy, strong, vibrant, and to rest in the unforced rhythms of grace Jesus so lovingly makes available to us all. Come along and learn how to avoid habits that seem smart but are deceptively self-sabotaging, pick up habits of wholeness that actually stick, and try surprising ways to practice kindness toward yourself and generosity toward loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bright Life &lt;/em&gt;extends a daily invitation with striking insights, tips to reclaim your energy, and a three-part practice of looking inward, upward, and outward as you step into a brighter way. This&amp;nbsp;40-day reset weaves story and Scripture together to cultivate a peaceful place where, through the attentive love of Jesus, you can experience the unforced rhythms of grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />

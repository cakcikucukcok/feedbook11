  <title>The Senator and the Priest - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of America&#39;s most beloved storytellers, Father Andrew Greeley returns with an explosive novel about the corrosive political culture tearing apart America--and one man&#39;s family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tommy Moran, an Irish Catholic kid from the West Side of Chicago, fights for the underprivileged on the floor of the United States Senate. Swearing off negative attack ads, Moran is determined to restore civility and compassion to American politics. But his opponents don&#39;t share his scruples. Almost from the beginning, Tommy and his family find themselves besieged by vicious personal attacks, false rumors . . . and attempts at assassination!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a freshman senator, Tommy must also cope with the temptations--both political and carnal--regularly thrown his way. The job takes its toll on him, but at least he has the support and love of his devoted wife, a daughter of Chicago&#39;s raucous O&#39;Malley family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the opposition that hits home the hardest comes from an unlikely source: his own brother.&lt;br&gt; Father Tony Moran, a conservative Catholic priest, has never approved of Tommy&#39;s senatorial career, much to Tommy&#39;s dismay. So when Father Tony sides with Tommy&#39;s political enemies, it may be more than one man can bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can anything heal the rift between...the Senator and the Priest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>First Family - L.A. Carnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you do if your child was murdered by the very people He was there to save? 
While the Lord grieved the death of His only Son, demons spewed forth from hell, indiscriminatingly infecting all in their path. By the time Gods attention returned to Earth, evil coursed through the veins of many. Including a rabbi and his family. 
Standing vigil over Jesuss broken body as it drooped forward in death, iron nails tearing through flesh and bone, they were at the forefront of the assault. Returning home, one of the rabbis twin daughters, Hannah, rips out the heart of her husband and young child. 
After centuries of taking anything they desired, the family realised they despise everything theyve become. In the hope of atoning for their sins, they hunt the planets most evil human or demon; they have no preference. For Hannah, finding her way back comes with a price. The horror of murdering the two she loved most constantly haunts her. 
Two young children found on the edge of a road in Mississippi lead them to evil beyond anything they have only encountered once before." />

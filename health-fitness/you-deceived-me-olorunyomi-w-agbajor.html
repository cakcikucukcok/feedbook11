  <title>You Deceived Me - Olorunyomi W. Agbajor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book speaks to readers of true Christian hope, the kind that can see the promise of life, even in the face of despair. It honestly states that marriage can grow to become a burden, but that Gods Word offers comfort and encouragement. The book speaks of how the false impressions husbands and wives hold of one another become apparent as the gloss wears off of the new marriage, but the message of the book as a whole is about the growth that comes after both husband and wife recognize the mutual deception. Professor Agbajor lays out the main message of the book in the following words: No matter the state of your marriage and emotional disposition right now, as you are reading this book, I want you to know that your story has not yet arrived at its closing stage. There is still hope. Even though your life has become an elegiac verse of sorrows and deception, Gods Word promises restoration. May the words of God as recorded in Joel embrocate your soul like a healing salve rubbed on a wound.&lt;/p&gt;" />

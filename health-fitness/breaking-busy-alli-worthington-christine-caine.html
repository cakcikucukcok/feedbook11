  <title>Breaking Busy - Alli Worthington, Christine Caine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever felt like a fraud or failure as you struggle to find balance in life? Do you find yourself juggling everything in mediocrity and feeling like you&#39;re succeeding at very little? In her no-nonsense style, Alli Worthington - popular podcaster and author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Year of Living Happy -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;tackles the big questions about finding happiness and one&#39;s God-given purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like a fraud or failure as you struggle to find balance in life? Do you find yourself juggling everything in mediocrity and feeling like you&amp;rsquo;re succeeding at very little? In her no-nonsense way, Alli Worthington tackles the big questions about finding happiness and one&amp;rsquo;s God-given purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breaking Busy&lt;/em&gt; marries popular secular research from the fields of social and positive psychology with solid biblical principles, instilling readers with the confidence that they, too, can move from crazy busy to confident calm. With refreshing candor, uproarious true stories, and a Christian worldview, Alli delivers truths that dismantle common happiness myths. Then she empowers readers to get unstuck, to let go of the good to make way for the great, to know themselves and their Creator, and ultimately to find peace and purpose in this world of crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how to stop chasing what leaves you empty and start doing what you were created to do. Identify the common lies you believe and how to strip their power from your life. Recognize how what you say no to determines what you can say yes to. With relatable anecdotes, Alli models for readers real-life guidance on boundaries, relationships, and self-care, humbly examining her own mistakes and walking them through how she learned from her missteps and found peace in a world of busyness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you long to find real connection in an age of over-connectedness, with both your loved ones and your Creator, Alli Worthington deftly balances intelligent humility and heartwarming humor to help you rediscover your path.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Living in the Age of Apathy - Gregory Alexander Chinama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living in the Age of Apathy&lt;/strong&gt; is a captivating and insightful book that takes an in depth look at how apathy could be the downfall of the United States and perhaps humanity.&lt;p&gt;In this informative and engaging discussion of apathy, Army combat veteran, Gregory A. Chinama explores how apathy is the root cause in the destruction of the values and foundation of family as he experienced first-hand with his failed marriage. Chinama further explains that apathy is the ultimate reason to why the divorce rate in the U.S. continues to rise. Chinama also analyzes the youth in America and shows how many of our teenagers have adopted an &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot; attitude towards issues that are important in our society today. Politics is no exception; Chinama holds nothing back when identifying apathy among those whom Americans elect to be humble servants of the people. From comedians to the music we listen to, &lt;strong&gt;Living in the Age of Apathy&lt;/strong&gt; will force you to question the country and the world in which we live. &lt;p&gt;While a brilliant and eye-opening book, Chinama&#39;s Living in The Age of Apathy is crucial in a time of declining faith and rising doubt of a prosperous future.&lt;/p&gt;" />

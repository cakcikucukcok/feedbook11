  <title>Skeward Images - Nick Armbrister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is Nick Armbrister&#39;s second volume of poetry, and follows his first book, &lt;I&gt;Fade into Focus, Focus into Fade&lt;/I&gt;, released in 2006-bringing the number of poems he has published to over 150. Again, his subject matter varies as does his mood and outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nick likes to write simple poems that convey his emotions and thoughts first hand, to be shared with his readers and audience. Music, life, aviation, gothic culture, and more besides, inspire his poetry in which he dares to bare his heart, soul and mind-in brittle, startling poems that touch the raw nerves of life, yet a life that throbs with positive energy. As one reviewer put it, he &quot;sees the dark underbelly of the world but counterpoints it with hope and warnings about falling into the same traps&quot; (D. J. Turner in &lt;I&gt;The Supplement&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />

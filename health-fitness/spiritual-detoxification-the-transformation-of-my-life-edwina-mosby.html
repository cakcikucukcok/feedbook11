  <title>Spiritual Detoxification: the Transformation of My Life - Edwina Mosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its amazing how events take place in your life just to make you
comprehend what is really important. At the tender age of 26, I started a transformation
that disciplined my character as a woman for the rest of my life. I began the process of
spiritual detoxifi cation. Detoxifi cation means to remove poison or harmful substances. I
cleansed my body in every sense of the word. Over the duration of the detoxifi cation,
which was a little over a year, I stopped eating red meat, pork, reduced my consumption
of bread, became abstinent, lost 42 pounds, was empowered with the gift of discernment,
and my walk with God became stronger than ever.
This is a book that will inspire not only those who have suffered from depression,
resentment, anger, and/or thoughts of suicide, but those who profess to have a spiritual
foundation in a higher being." />

  <title>The Power of Middle School - Keen J. Babbage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The middle school years are a maze of academic duties, human growth and self-development, discovering self identity, and increasing social interaction with other people. This maze can be an adventure of achievement and opportunity, or it can be a struggle of difficulty and disappointment. As these experiences are the impetus or foundation for many later achievements in academics, careers, and personal life, it is imperative that educators maximize these formative years by helping middle school students successfully travel through this maze despite its ups and downs, its twists and turns, and its new challenges to master and the old issues to resolve. For instance, educators must support students who have fallen behind, so as to thwart their reduced likelihood of turnaround in high school. Likewise, educators must challenge exceptional students, in order to perpetuate their enthusiasm for learning and prepare them for college studies. By discussing the comprehensive roles and duties of school administrators, counselors, and teachers, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Power of Middle School&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; addresses how to maximize middle school curriculum and extra-curricular activities for the academic, personal, and professional benefits of all students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

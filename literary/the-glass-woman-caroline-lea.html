But after her father dies abruptly and her Mamma becomes ill, R&amp;#243;sa marries herself off to a visiting trader in exchange for a dowry, despite rumors of mysterious circumstances surrounding his first wife&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R&amp;#243;sa follows her new husband, J&amp;#243;n, across the treacherous countryside to his remote home near the sea. There J&amp;#243;n works the field during the day, expecting R&amp;#243;sa to maintain their house in his absence with the deference of a good Christian wife. What R&amp;#243;sa did not anticipate was the fierce loneliness she would feel in her new home, where J&amp;#243;n forbids her from interacting with the locals in the nearby settlement and barely speaks to her himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seclusion from the outside world isn&amp;#8217;t the only troubling aspect of her new life&amp;#8212;R&amp;#243;sa is also forbidden from going into J&amp;#243;n&amp;#8217;s attic. When R&amp;#243;sa begins to hear strange noises from upstairs, she turns to the local woman in an attempt to find solace. But the villager&amp;#8217;s words are even more troubling&amp;#8212;confirming many of the rumors about J&amp;#243;n&amp;#8217;s first wife, Anna, including that he buried her body alone in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R&amp;#243;sa&amp;#8217;s isolation begins to play tricks on her mind: What&amp;#8212;or who&amp;#8212;is in the attic? What happened to Anna? Was she mad, a witch, or just a victim of J&amp;#243;n&amp;#8217;s ruthless nature? And when J&amp;#243;n is brutally maimed in an accident a series of events are set in motion that will force R&amp;#243;sa to choose between obedience and defiance&amp;#8212;with her own survival and the safety of the ones she loves hanging in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

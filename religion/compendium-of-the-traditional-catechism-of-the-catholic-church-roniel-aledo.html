  <title>Compendium of the Traditional Catechism of the Catholic Church - Roniel Aledo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;/b&gt; is the sure norm for teaching the faith (Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum ). Still the language and wording of both the Catechism and the Second Vatican Council is one full of poetic beauty and soft diplomacy. This style of poetry and diplomacy is not the most appropriate for clarity. In many places the language results hard to understand and multiple contradictory interpretations are possible due precisely to the language full of charity but not of clarity. The purpose of the Compendium of the Traditional Catechism of the Catholic Church is to provide absolute clarity about the Faith of All times and less room for open interpretations and ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The world today in order to keep the Faith of All times needs more than poetic words. It needs clear teachings with full power, strength, and clarity above: no room for misinterpretations, no wiggle room for heretical interpretations at all. That is the purpose of this work: high clarity above all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;With total clarity several subjects are covered: the definition of schismatic, the Limbo, Freemasons, heretic, the so called marriage among homosexuals, the doctrine of the Church regarding the liberal freemasonic Democracy, the responsibility that Catholics must have when voting or taking action on the political field, the so called New Atheists movement, the Consecration of Russia according to Our Lady of Fatima, the future of the world according to the City of God of St. Agustin, etc. All of these subjects of today and many others are addressed in this work with extreme and total clarity. Here there is no room for error and no room for misunderstanding. This is the Traditional Catechism that is really needed in the Year of the Faith and in any year!&lt;/p&gt;" />

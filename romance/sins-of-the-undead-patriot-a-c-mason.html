  <title>Sins of the Undead Patriot - a.c. Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To save the President, Vaihan must trust the woman who betrayed him. &lt;P&gt; Vaihan Louchian, Ancient Zombie and Special Advisor to the President, dabbles in contracts for Homeland Security in Washington DC, the only remaining demilitarized zone. His latest mission: to seduce delectable Leera Waltz so he can take down her boyfriend Rowley, leader of the anti-zombie terrorist movement. Vaihan and the President work the Bill of Undead Rights through the Senate, but terrorist attacks rise. The futures of the living and undead are in jeopardy, and Ms. Waltz is not all she seems. Vaihan canÆt help being more interested in rescuing her than in his assignment. Any human female who&#39;s willing to put up with the complications of lovemaking with him and his bouts of OCD is worth the hassle.Vaihan is powerful, intelligent and kind. So not what Leera expected of an undead. When she&#39;s forced to betray Vaihan, she knows he will never understand. She must return to Rowley, and slips deeper into the city&#39;s dark underworld. Then Vaihan&#39;s suspected in an assassination attempt against the President, and Leera has to find the courage to do what&#39;s right and save him, or lose not only Vaihan and the leader of the free world, but her heart and soul.&lt;p&gt;101,868 Words" />

  <title>Prelude to Chaos - John V. Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book characterizes what we already know, have observed, and identified as real problems with our educational system; relates the identified problems to more in-depth causes; delves further into these causes; and proposes fundamentally different and unique solutions to the problems with our schools and our society.
The chapter units of this book are highly interrelated. Chapter 1 discusses the theory related to the neurosis caused by unfulfilled needs leading to disruptive students. Chapter 2 explains, in greater detail, how the developed neurosis affects our students, our schools and our society. The resulting accelerating degenerative effects on teachers and administrators; all resulting in our ineffective schools are explained in chapters 3 and 4. A unique solution to our dilemma is presented in chapter 5 while Chapter 7 presents ideas on how to execute the solution. And several factors which may help with the funding of our schools are discussed in Chapter 6." />

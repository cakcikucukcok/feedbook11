  <title>Hypnotism for Beginners: Learn How to Influence and Hypnotize Someone Instantly and Effectively - Charlie Spark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hypnotism has been viewed as a supernatural phenomenon throughout the years. It has been portrayed as a technique that can only be done by a few selected individuals. Yet, that is not the case. In the real world, supernatural phenomenon does not exist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In truth, what we will be learning is simply the branch of how hypnotism works. Hypnotism is not any form phenomenon. Rather, it is the process of influencing others without their knowledge through the eloquence of words. It is because of this that many individuals have deemed it to be a form of hypnosis and the term has been passed on for many years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a skill that you will be able to learn and use for future purposes. Not only will this book provide you with the knowledge to use these skills, but it will also give in an in depth explanation on how you are able to influence others without their knowledge." />

      <meta name="description" content="Martin makes a decision: from now on, he will not brush his teeth.&lt;br/&gt;
And so he does until one night when a tooth falls, a very special animal comes to visit him: he is the Little Mouse Perez!&lt;br/&gt;
The rodent appoints him as an honorary assistant during one night, so Martín has the opportunity to accompany him on his magical working day.&lt;br/&gt;
Together with the Little Mouse Pérez, Martín will visit many boys, girls, men and women and will see the importance of having good oral hygiene.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A children&#39;s book recommended for boys and girls from 6-7 years.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

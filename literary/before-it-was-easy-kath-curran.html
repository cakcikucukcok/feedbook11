  <title>Before It Was Easy - Kath Curran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tidewaterfestival.com/whistler-independent-book-awards-2016-finalists/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalist: Whistler Independent Book Award for 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Claire has always been a woman of action, a woman surging through life&amp;rsquo;s challenges, blind to the tragedies left in her wake. Claire&amp;rsquo;s younger sister Heather and Claire&amp;rsquo;s daughter Nora follow behind, picking up the pieces, making things right. Or so it has always seemed to Heather and Nora.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I was young Claire was my big sister,&amp;rdquo; says Heather. &amp;ldquo;When I had my own family she was my older sister who enjoyed life and maybe drank a bit too much; then she was my sister who fell down the stairs and had a brain injury, my sister who got on with the business of life and scolded me for worrying. Now she&amp;rsquo;s getting on with the business of dying and suddenly I realize I don&amp;rsquo;t know who she is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before It Was Easy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; is a story of damage done and tenderness found. It is a story inspired by personal loss, a story that straddles the boundaries of memoir and fiction. &amp;ldquo;We tell stories to make sense of our lives,&amp;rdquo; says author Kath Curran. &amp;ldquo;Such a story may be framed within the surface details of a life lived, but reaching the deep truths&amp;mdash;surfacing the intertwining textures of pain and tenderness that make a life real&amp;mdash;this is the work of imagination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Told through the voices of its three main characters, &lt;em&gt;Before It Was Easy&lt;/em&gt; s about learning to speak the stories that return us to our beginnings, about following those threads of pain and tenderness that reveal to us, perhaps for the first time, who &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; really are.&lt;/p&gt;" />

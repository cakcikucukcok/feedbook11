  <title>From Willard Straight to Wall Street - Thomas W. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In stark and compelling prose, Thomas W. Jones tells his story as a campus revolutionary who led an armed revolt at Cornell University in 1969 and then altered his course over the next fifty years to become a powerful leader in the financial industry including high-level positions at John Hancock, TIAA—CREF and Citigroup as Wall Street plunged into its darkest hour. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;From Willard Straight to Wall Street&lt;/I&gt; provides a front row seat to the author&#39;s triumphs and struggles as he was twice investigated by the SEC—and emerged unscathed. His searing perspective as an African American navigating a world dominated by whites reveals a father, a husband, a trusted colleague, a Cornellian, and a business leader who confronts life with an unwavering resolve that defies cliché and offers a unique perspective on the issues of race in America today. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The book begins on the steps of Willard Straight Hall where Jones and his classmates staged an occupation for two days that demanded a black studies curriculum at Cornell. The Straight Takeover resulted in the resignation of Cornell President James Perkins with whom Jones reconciled years later. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Jones witnessed the destruction of the World Trade Centers on 911 from his office at ground zero and then observed first-hand the wave of scandals that swept the banking industry over the next decade. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;From Willard Straight to Wall Street&lt;/I&gt; reveals one of the most interesting American stories of the last fifty years.&lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>An Outer Banks Reader - David Stick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For half a century, David Stick has been writing books about the fragile chain of barrier islands off the North Carolina coast known as the Outer Banks. Two of his earliest, &lt;i&gt;Graveyard of the Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Outer Banks of North Carolina&lt;/i&gt;, were published by the UNC Press in the 1950s, and continue to be best-sellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     More recently, Stick embarked on another project, searching for the most captivating and best-written examples of what others have said about his beloved Outer Banks. In the process, more than 1,000 books, pamphlets, periodicals, historical documents, and other writings were reviewed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The result is a rich and fascinating anthology. The selections in &lt;i&gt;An Outer Banks Reader&lt;/i&gt; span the course of more than four and a half centuries, from the first known record of a meeting between Europeans and Native Americans in the region in 1524 to modern-day accounts of life on the Outer Banks. Together, Stick hopes, the sixty-four entries may provide both &quot;outlanders&quot; and natives with an understanding of why the Outer Banks are home to a rapidly growing number of people who would rather spend the rest of their lives there than any place else on earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

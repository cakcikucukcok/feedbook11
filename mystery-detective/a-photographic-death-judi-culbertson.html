  <title>A Photographic Death - Judi Culbertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bookseller-turned-amateur detective Delhi Laine is back with another atmospheric mystery&amp;#8212;but this time, it&amp;#39;s a family affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen years ago, Delhi Laine&amp;#39;s two-year-old daughter disappeared. After a frantic but inconclusive search, authorities determined that she must have drowned, her body washed away from the picturesque English park in which she had been playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delhi&amp;#39;s heart has never healed, yet her family has since soldiered on. But when a mysterious letter arrives containing the ominous words &lt;em&gt;Your daughter did not drown&lt;/em&gt;, their lives are once again thrown into turmoil. With her family torn between fighting for the past and protecting the future, Delhi is caught in the middle. For a mother, the choice to find her daughter seems easy. But for a family left fractured by the mistakes of the past, the consequences, and the reality, may be infinitely more costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of Carolyn Hart will be swept away by this story of a family on the brink&amp;#8212;and their hunt for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />

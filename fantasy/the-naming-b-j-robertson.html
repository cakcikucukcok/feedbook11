  <title>The Naming - B.J. Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marcus had been busy getting his gear together.  Fortunately he had come off the ship with his tool belt.  Everything in it was like pure gold.  Along with two screw drivers, a pair of pliers an awl, some wire and some twine, he also had a good large pocket knife and a hunting knife.  He would leave his belt and tools in Rondace with Hank but both knives would go with him.  He had also spent time making fine strips of leather to braid for a really strong rope.  Areels Aunt wove a good warm travel cloak for him.  It would double as a blanket.  He was given two horses and a donkey to travel with.  He made nice leather leads for the horses, also made a heavy riding pad for his horse.  It was a heavy pad for the horses back with a large pocket on each side that hung down in back of his legs.  Though it was not strapped to the horse, the weight of the rider held it in place.  He made a pack rack for the donkey out of braches and more braided leather straps to hold it in places." />

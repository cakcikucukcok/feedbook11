  <title>Evans to Betsy - Rhys Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; The sixth book in the charming and critically acclaimed series set in a tiny Welsh village, Rhys Bowen&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Evans to Betsy&lt;/i&gt;.    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charming village of Llanfair, the setting for Rhys Bowen&#39;s beloved Constable Evans mysteries, sits amid lush, rolling Welsh meadows populated with quaint cottages and is considered by many of its colorful locals to be a kind of paradise. Unfortunately, there aren&#39;t many opportunities for young people in Llanfair, so when an exciting and glamorous American woman breezes into town talking of dormant psychic powers and important social research, barmaid Betsy Edwards is quick to take her up on an offer of employment at the recently opened Sacred Grove New Age center not far away. Of course the locals, including the village constable, Evan Evans, think Betsy has gone around the bend, not to mention the nutty American who dragged her off to be &quot;tested.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betsy, though, is dazzled at the possibility of exploring her own sixth sense. And she&#39;s only a little surprised when her new powers are put to a real-life test; when the center&#39;s flamboyant director goes missing, clues to his fate mysteriously appear in Betsy&#39;s dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a tantalizing mystery for lonely Betsy, who can&#39;t help doing a little investigating on her own. But Constable Evans has been involved with Sacred Grove before-looking for a missing American college student who was lured there by Druid worship. As Betsy does her own sleuthing on the spot, Evan comes to realize that there is nothing straightforward about this case and that Betsy has no idea at all of the terrible danger she is in.&lt;/p&gt;" />

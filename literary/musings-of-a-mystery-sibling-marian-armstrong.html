  <title>Musings of a Mystery Sibling - Marian Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ellen Bannister is a moderately successful editor with a lackluster life. Several years after the sudden death of her charismatic, well-loved brother, John, she continues to struggle through life, trying to find meaning and purpose in her quiet, unexciting existence. Out of the blue, she receives a mysterious and intimate letter from an elderly apple farmer in upstate New York, prompting her to relive the day she learned of Johns death. 
When a second letter arrives from the farmer, she realizes that she has been given an invitation to engagean opportunity to test her brothers theories on life. The unexpected friendship that develops between her and the farmer gives her the courage to explore a life she never imagined for herself, and she finds the resilience to take a risk with his fiery-natured son. 
The premature loss of a brother or sister, a relationship that is expected to be one of the longest of your life, is a loss that is deeply felt but seldom explored. &lt;i&gt;The Musings of a Mystery Sibling,&lt;/i&gt; a love story on many levels, does just that.
Musings of a Mystery Sibling received an Honorable Mention Award in the 19th Annual Writer&#39;s Digest Self-Published Book Awards. Judge&#39;s commentary: &quot;Engaging opening--great emotional showing on the part of the narrator. The death of the brother packs a tremendous emotional wallop--very skillfully executed. Excellent selection of words and wise choices for an elevating reading experience.&quot;" />

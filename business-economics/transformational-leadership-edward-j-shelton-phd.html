  <title>Transformational Leadership - Edward J. Shelton PhD.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shelton introduces his latest book Transformational Leadership which is an insightful review of how effective leaders develop skills, behaviors and respect from those around them.Transformational Leadership methods highlight the importance of individualized attention, trust and relationship building by identifying preferred leadership characteristics and behaviors making it a philosophy and a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformational leadership is a powerful change agent. It engages individuals leading them to change, improve and participate in a meaningful way. These leadership qualities are not secret and have been applied throughout history to cause willful behavior changes.The results have proven to build trust, kindness, integrity and empowerment. Effective communication, motivation and courage all are examined in detail with supporting cases and antidotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective leadership is a learned art that creates an exemplary role model for others.Transformational leaders are respected because they put the interests of those around them before their own.These leaders inspire and stimulate critical thinking, promote team work and encourage individual development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shelton often says, people do not leave their organization, they leave their boss.Trust, motivation and engagement are leadership outcomes that separate organizations that are led by managers versus leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Edward Shelton is an international speaker with powerful voice in the dialogue on leadership, behavior and culture.He advanced his philosophy of Transformational Leadership development as a HR professional with international organizations that include Saudi Aramco Oil Company, Penn State University as an assistant professor and the U.S. Army as an Infantry officer.Dr. Shelton holds a PhD in Business Administration with research in leadership and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shelton introduces his latest book, Transformational Leadership, which is an insightful review of how effective leaders develop skills, behaviors and respect from those around them.Transformational Leadership methods highlight the importance of individualized attention, trust and building relationships by identifying preferred leadership characteristics and behaviors; making it a philosophy and a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformational Leadership is filled with examples of successes and failures which provide a unique look into culture, personality disorders, constructive leadership practices and dark leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People dont leave the company, they leave their boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont slap the dolphin they will never perform again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Physician Rule, Use the lease radical surgery to cure the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pat on the back is a few inches from a kick in the pants yet the results are miles apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See others for not what they are now, but for what they can become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will trust you if you have integrity, benevolence, and you have perfected your skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders use effective communications which are expressions of affection and not anger, facts and not fabrication, compassion and not contention, respect and not ridicule, counsel and not criticism, correction and not condemnation. Their words are spoken with clarity and not with confusion. They may be tender or they may be tough, but they must always be tempered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral courage is the willingness to stand firm on values, principles, and convictions. It enables all leaders to stand up for what they believe is right, regardless of the consequences. Leaders, who take full responsibility for their decisions and actions, even when things go wrong, display moral courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doing nothing wrong is not the same as doing the right thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the communists, and I did not speak outbecause I was not a communist;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak outbecause I was not a socialist;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak outbecause I was not a trade unionist;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak outbecause I was not a Jew;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came for meand there was no one left to speak out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then They Came&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Niemller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destructive Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the four most common destructive forms of communication are those of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying will destroy a leaders integrity and trust. Integrity is the core of our character. Without integrity we have a weak foundation upon which to build other leadership characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a condemning communication. When people are afraid to accept accountability, they begin to place the blame on others.Weak leaders tend to blame mistakes and problems on others or on circumstances.When we attempt to place responsibility for our choices on others, we are responding in a leaderless manner.More importantly, do not allow those under you to fall into the habit of blaming; encourage them to seek root causes  never blame or point fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive or constructive criticism is feedback given with the purpose of helping another person to grow and to develop. This is both helpful and needful and is generally accepted and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative criticism is intended to hurt and often to defame and destroy. This caustic communication is cruel, and it tends to crush the character of all of those whom it is directed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most common form of destructive communication. Anger causes anguish to everyone who experiences the feeling, as well as to those who are the recipients of this emotional explosion.Anger shows a lack of self-control and an inability to relate in a professional way to others. It is a senseless substitute for self-control. It is sometimes used as a selfish strategy to gain control of a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Edward Shelton is the author of They Love You They Hate You Discovering Leadership.He is a respected international conference speaker on preferred leadership, knowledge transfer and motivation.Dr. Sheltons work reflects a lifelong fascination of leadership as he has gained unique perspectives with his experiences that span industry, academia and military.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Passageways - Philip Resnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Passageways is a major collection of Philip Resnick&#39;s poetry, spanning over 40 years. A number of the poems in the first section of the book, &quot;Of the Greeks and Hebrews,&quot; were in earlier collections, which have long been out of print. The other four sections of the book tackle a wide variety of topics. &quot;Faraway Shores&quot; evokes various places the author has visited or lived in over the course of a long career. &quot;In Troubled Times&quot; contains poems dealing with political themes, some clearly contemporary in character, others more historical in scope. &quot;Meditations and Reflections&quot; contains a wide range of poems with literary, philosophical, as well as autobiographical underpinnings. The final section of the book, &quot;Thanatos&#39;s Shadow,&quot; deals with the challenges of facing the death of a loved one and the bereavement which follows. Greece, and the region of Mount Pelion in particular, has been a major source of inspiration for Resnick&#39;s poetry over the years and this is strongly reflected in many of the poems in this collection." />

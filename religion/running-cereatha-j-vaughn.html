      <meta name="description" content="Running, The HAND That Dealt the C.A.R.D.S. is a
heart rending account of one womans journey of life
growing up in an abusive home. This startling story divulges the
various forms of abuse she endured under the domination of her
father, which lured her into the streets placing her in situations
that nearly cost her life.
I cried, I laughed, I cringed and I praised God as I read this book
that genuinely reveals how Jesus does not give up on the worst
of usbut pursues all of us with His love, His forgiveness and His
promise of a future and a hope. The honest and direct style of the
authors writing, combined with the candid way she tells her own
personal experiences, strengthens the impact her testimony will
have on the reader." />

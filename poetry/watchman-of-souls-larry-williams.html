  <title>Watchman of Souls - Larry Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There has been a conviction placed on my heart for many years to write this book of inspirational poems and words of encouragement for Gods people. It has lead me to write of many personal conflicts, fears and problems that plague Gods people today as well as words of encouragement and praise and thanksgiving that so often beset our trials and tribulations. It is not my intention to offend or judge anyone who is reading this book, I stand first in line to say that Im not perfect and that I fall from time to time too but God has a mandate on my life and every other Christian to live a Holy life style. I only wrote as the spirit of God was laid on my heart to do so, I pray that this book will bring enlightenment, courage and strength of heart to any who may read these words as it has my own and be a blessing to all people.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Is America Exceptional? - Richard Balmert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book continues the saga of the progeny of the Marciari family, founded in Florence during the Renaissance, wandering through many European countries, losing contacts, but over time migrating to the new continent.
Commencing as the Thirteen English Colonies in America are preparing to launch their struggle for independence from the mother country, the novel continues to present times  a history of the United States. Told from the chronicles of family descendants, the reader becomes a part of the individual lives of those who created American Exceptionalism.
Reflecting America, these &quot;cousins&quot; work closely with the titans of history. Through their records, we observe George Washington as he ponders the fate of the patriot troops at Valley Forge; experience the dangers of the unknown with the expedition of Lewis and Clark exploring the new lands obtained through the Louisiana Purchase from Napoleon Bonaparte; or live through the long trek across the United States in a covered wagon to California during the  Gold Rush. We participate in the meetings conducted by J. P. Morgan as he provides advice to President Cleveland in resolving the Panic of 1893, watch a cousin decline Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s invitation to join the Rough Riders; or become absorbed with Woodrow Wilson&#39;s problems with his Peace Plans. Suffer the agonies of loved ones killed in war, the depravations and anxieties of those with jobs eliminated and homes lost in the Great Depression and Dust storms of the nineteen thirties.
The innovative new government generated administration and emulation. As the nation grew in size, population and wealth, it gained the appellation, exceptionalism, becoming the envy of the world. However, the challenges facing the new culture soon demonstrated the ugly features of human nature
	Confiscation of Native Americans lands
	Enslavement of millions of Africans
	Barriers to immigration
	Delays in providing assistance to nations beset by invasion
	Wide income gap between the wealthy and poor
	Continuation of racial discrimination 
	Violence perpetuated by gun ownership" />

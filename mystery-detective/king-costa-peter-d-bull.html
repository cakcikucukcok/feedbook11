  <title>King Costa - Peter D. Bull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vinnie Miller is a successful drug importer on the Costa del Sol. He lures his son John into the firm, although he didn&#39;t want anything to do with the gang. Due to the hatred John has for Vinnie, he plans the takeover of the business with the help of a gang member. John tracks down his long lost brother, and between the three men, they con Vinnie into believing that a load of cannabis has been seized by the Spanish police. In a fit of anger, Vinnie kills two of his mules, but doesn&#39;t tell John what he&#39;s done. John perpetuates the illusion that the police are onto them. Vinnie disappears to his villa in Barbados. In a drink and drug binge, he beats up his new Barbadian girlfriend and leaves her scarred for life. With the help of Troy, a local man, John and his brother plan the horrific death of their father. Troy&#39;s friend is arrested for another murder and informs on Troy. Troy informs on the brothers, and the whole thing falls apart when arrests are made in Spain." />

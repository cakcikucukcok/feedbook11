  <title>Stuff to Spy For - Don Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Best friends James Lessor and Skip Moore are still stuck in dead-end jobs, still living in their ratty apartment in Carol City, Florida, and still dreaming of hitting the big time. It seems those dreams are finally within reach when James lands a job to install a state-of-the-art security system for Synco Systems. There&#39;s a huge commission-and plenty of strings-attached. To collect on the cash, James will have to provide additional services by assuming the role of pretend boyfriend of Sarah Crumbly, an employee who&#39;s having an affair with Sandler Conroy, Synco&#39;s married president.When Sandler&#39;s wife offers James a tidy sum for the dirty details about what&#39;s going on at Synco, James and Skip resurrect their entrepreneurial dreams and go into the business of being spies. The spymobile-their beloved, rattletrap of a boxtruck-is on its last legs, and they&#39;ll have to spend a small fortune on spy equipment, but there&#39;s no business like spy business.In this spy game, James and Skip may be the ones who get played-or worse." />

  <title>Good to Go - Harold Constance, Randall Fuerst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Fractions of a second in time. What amazing violence can be meted out in the blink of an eye.&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-nineteen sixties, Harry Constance made a life-altering journey that led him out of Texas and into the jungles of Vietnam. As a young naval officer, he went from UDT training to the U.S. Navy&amp;#39;s newly formed SEAL Team Two, and then straight into furious action. By 1970, he was already the veteran of three hundred combat missions and the recipient of thirty-two military citations, including three Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good To Go&lt;/em&gt; is Constance&amp;#39;s powerful, firsthand account of his three tours of duty as a member of America&amp;#39;s most elite, razor-sharp stealth fighting force. It is a breathtaking memoir of harrowing missions and covert special-ops&amp;#8212;from the floodplains of the Mekong Delta to the beaches of the South China Sea&amp;#8212;that places the reader in the center of bloody ambushes and devastating firefights. But his extraordinary adventure goes even farther&amp;#8212;beyond &amp;#39;Nam&amp;#8212;as we accompany Constance and the SEALs on astonishing missions to some of the world&amp;#39;s most dangerous hot-spots . . . and experience close-up the courage, dedication, and unparalleled skill that made the U.S. Navy SEALs legendary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Includes 8 Pages of SEAL Team Action Photos!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Jesus in a Fairy Tale - Mary Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In every part of anything we do, Jesus is present. This book piques the imagination of children who want to learn more about Jesus. It will guide the teacher to a new approach through lessons, participation, playacting, and games. If you ever wondered how to teach children in a way that would hold their attention and give them better understanding, then these are the lessons for you. Each section is planned separately according to what is being taught and can be used for any age group. The idea of a fairy tale is used to teach about leadership, love, and building a strong foundation. Use the current-events lesson to teach about trust in God. There is even a section on sports. One lesson is named Hit a Home Run for God. All lessons are informative and creative, and they all allow the children to use their imagination. The holidays are taught in an unusual way. The Christmas lesson is titled The Thinker, and it brings a message that is clear to all. The games and music sections are included to challenge childrens minds and incite curiosity as well as fun. My book is for teachers who want to do more than read or talk to the class about Jesusit is meant to be used to captivate their minds and encourage learning.&lt;/p&gt;" />

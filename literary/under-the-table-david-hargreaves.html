  <title>Under the Table - David Hargreaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dominic da Silva, in his late fifties, has terminal cancer. This diagnosis prompts him to return to the diaries he kept from his boarding school years into his early thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These notebooks conjure lost tableaux of Britain in the 1960s, 70s and early 80s: with the emotional repression and genteel rural poverty of his youth, through to upbeat accounts of later joyful excess and profound friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominic has the chameleon qualities of the true survivor: by the age of thirty, he has carved out a promising career and is married to a wealthy young lawyer, herself the very epitome of upward mobility. But he&#39;s cursed, it seems, by wanting everything to which he&#39;s supremely ill-suited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarter of a century later, it all looks very different. His has, in many ways, been a thwarted existence, and Dominic&#39;s diaries chart his lurching journey towards self-recognition - from grand house parties to a hostel for the homeless, from an apparently perfect life to arrest and ignominy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under the Table&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful homage to truth and friendship - and a recognition of the toughness upon which both depend.&lt;/p&gt;" />

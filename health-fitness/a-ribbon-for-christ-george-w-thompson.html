  <title>A Ribbon for Christ - George W. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story content is about a small family, a chapter from their lives consisting of the
realisms of life, and setting an example for children in morality and character as they
become tomorrows mature adults.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The story starts one Christmas but could start any day of the year. It is about a young
and only child who is missing something in his life. He gets a pet, and this pet becomes his
best present and one of his best friends that real life can off er. Reality is not without some
struggle. This family that is strong in faith will become even more bonded as they face lifes
trials together.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This is a story of the love of a child for his parents and their pet. It is a story of the love of
parents for God, their child, and a family pet that touched their hearts unto forever. It is a
story of an animal that does what most animals will dothat is, to love unconditionallyand
he often sets an example that humans cannot follow.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It is a must read for children and animal lovers.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It is my pledge to God and man that 10 percent of my royalties arriving as a result of this
book will be donated to charities for the care of needy children and animals." />

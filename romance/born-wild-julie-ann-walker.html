  <title>Born Wild - Julie Ann Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Julie Ann Walker is one of those authors to be put on a keeper shelf with Nora Roberts, Suzanne Brockmann, and Allison Brennan.&quot; —&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Julie Ann Walker dives back into action with the red-hot romantic suspense Black Knights Inc. series!  They claim they&#39;re bad-boy bikers who own custom motorcycle shop, but these special-ops guys—a mix of Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Marines, FBI and more—handle the jobs too tough for the government to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TICK...TICK...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Reichert knows a thing or two about explosives. The ex-Navy SEAL can practically rig a bomb blindfolded. But there&#39;s no way to diffuse the inevitable fireworks the day Eve Edens walks back into his life, asking for help...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Eve doesn&#39;t know what to do when the Chicago police won&#39;t believe someone is out to hurt her. The only place to turn is Black Knights Inc-after all, no one is better at protection than the covert special-ops team. Yet there&#39;s also no one better at getting her all turned on than Billy Reichert. She has a feeling this is one blast from the past that could backfire big time...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

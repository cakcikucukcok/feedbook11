  <title>La bell&#39;America - Anthony M. Graziano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a delightful, passionate and memorable rendition of a familiar and glorious tale.  As the son of immigrants who were very much like Anthony Graziano&#39;s family, I was especially moved. Thank you for telling our story.&quot;&amp;#151;Governor Mario M. Cuomo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;This kind of historical data is rare today. . . . A tapestry of history, biography, personal reminiscence, and lessons.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Michael Giallombardo, director/producer of &lt;I&gt;La Terra Promessa&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;A sweeping narrative of European and American history, and a lovingly crafted reminiscence. Graziano is an excellent storyteller. There is something in this book for everyone, not least of which is a very good read.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Joan M. Crouse, author of &lt;I&gt;The Homeless Transient in the Great Depression&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;Writing in the tradition of C. Wright Mills, who defined [sociology] as the intersection between history and biography . . . this book clarifies the tremendous emigration from Italy. A very enjoyable read, suitable for general readers and students of history and sociology.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Adeline Levine, author of &lt;I&gt;Love Canal: Science, Politics, and People&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A picture of Europe&amp;#8217;s nineteenth century and the massive Italian immigration to America: wars and conflicts, popes and kings fighting the people&amp;#8217;s demands for democratic government. When religion and royalty failed them, leaders created dictatorships and threw the world into bloody conflicts, killing hundreds of millions and virtually destroying Europe. Caught up were the poverty stricken, powerless common people who became the immigrants, pushed from Europe, pulled to America. Their history comes alive in the author&amp;#8217;s deeply personal account of his family&amp;#8217;s immigration and survival through the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Anthony M. Graziano&lt;/B&gt;, SUNY Buffalo professor emeritus and Italian chef, has written fifteen books and fifty articles in the field of psychology. His brother, parents, and extended family emigrated from Italy. He says, &amp;#147;This book is a celebration of immigrants. It speaks to us because we are all immigrants.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>The Mermaid&#39;s Secret - Katie Schickel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Katie Schickel, one of &lt;i&gt;Booklist&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;Top 10 Women&#39;s fiction of 2015, comes &lt;i&gt;The Mermaid&#39;s Secret, &lt;/i&gt;an original, fresh, and absolutely captivating beach read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life on land is suffocating for Jess Creary, who wastes her summers flipping burgers for tourists on a fishing boat off her quaint resort island home off the coast of Maine. After all, her older sister Kay died in a boating accident two years ago, her mother has disappeared, and her father isn&#39;t exactly dealing with things so well. Surfing and the handsome Captain Matthew are about the only bright spots in her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on her twenty-third birthday, Jess catches the perfect wave--a wave that transforms her into a mermaid. Under the sea, a startlingly beautiful, dark place, Jess is reborn into a confident, powerful predator with superhuman strength --finally she is someone to be reckoned with. Meanwhile, back on land, Jess&#39;s relationship with Captain Matthew heats up, and so does her search for justice for Kay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jess has thirty days to choose between land and sea; legs and fins; her humanity and her freedom. Who could ignore the freedom of the sea? Yet, the ocean is a dark, wild, lonely place. Is this a gift or a curse? Will Jess choose family and love, forgiveness and truth, or will she be seduced by the wild call of the sparkling sea forever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>She Spoke Volumes . . . And Then Some - Onedia Nicole Gage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She Spoke Volumes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . And Then Some&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onedia N. Gage, Ph. D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many things that Onedia Gage does, speaking is one such gift. Not just her auditorium audiences and church congregations, but also her intimate audience and her social media audiences. When she speaks, she causes others to think, take action, and question their own life&amp;rsquo;s net worth. She challenges her audiences to consider their paths and strongly urges them to abandon the status quo and the mediocrity. She tasks her audiences to examine the details of their lives and ask the difficult questions so that they can achieve their best self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gage does what others wish they could or would, but she goes for it, risks it all, and abandons the safety net. She challenges others to do the same. In addition to the words, she demonstrates the work ethic, which suggests that others do the same. There is no question that she addresses truth as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her colleagues stated once that Onedia Gage was the most authentic person he knew. Another person mentioned that her words renders people speechless. A third person implores her to continue speaking the truth in the extraordinary manner in which she does because her encouragement is priceless. All agree that her words offer people a place to start the life that they always dreamed of; now they have run out of excuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let these words of wit and wisdom empower and energize you, overwhelm and challenge you, equip and encompass you so that you can move to the next level in your life, whether life, love, family or career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bearing one another&amp;rsquo;s burdens is the definition of love.&amp;rdquo; Onedia N. Gage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You cannot have an extraordinary life while walking with an ordinary attitude.&amp;rdquo; Onedia N. Gage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some of our most profound revelations develop when we are silent.&amp;rdquo; Onedia N. Gage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop finding reasons to underachieve and be mediocre. Stop trying to avoid your purpose and start being accountable for your destiny.&amp;rdquo; Onedia N. Gage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She speaks volumes. Just listen.&lt;/p&gt;" />

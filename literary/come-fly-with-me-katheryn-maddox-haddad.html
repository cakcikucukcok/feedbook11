  <title>Come Fly With Me - Katheryn Maddox Haddad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Come meet the people who met Jesus. &amp;nbsp;You are one of them &amp;nbsp;Probably you are several of them. Go ahead and struggle with him as they did. Laugh. Cry. &amp;nbsp;Do mental battle with him. &amp;nbsp;Emotional battle too. &amp;nbsp;Fight for your faith as they fought. &amp;nbsp;Pause to listen for what you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard before. &amp;nbsp;Then touch Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of faith in the impossible. &amp;nbsp; Hope in the inconceivable. &amp;nbsp;Love for the invincible. &amp;nbsp;It is the dreams of youth, the desperations of infirmity, the hopes of age, and the song of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the suspense as each person in Jesus&amp;rsquo; life comes to terms with who they are, and who Jesus is. &amp;nbsp;Jesus accepts them as they are. &amp;nbsp;But can they accept themselves as they are? &amp;nbsp;More than that, can they accept Jesus as he is? &amp;nbsp;Both God and man? &amp;nbsp;Both Creator and created? &amp;nbsp;Both King and servant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the story of doubts explained away, animosities melted away, misunderstandings cleared away. &amp;nbsp;It is your story and mine. &amp;nbsp;For deep within each of us is everyone who ever met and struggled with Jesus. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
They Met Jesus is a lyrical novel series with the reader allowed to give opinions. Also at the end of each chapter are discussion questions ancient historical records cited and scriptures used as a basis for the story&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the book are suggested chapter readings for special occasions It also has a three page bibliography of all books consulted while writing all eight volumes of Soul Journey With the Real Jesus This is not just a novel It is much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have the courage to enter the lives of first-century strugglers? &amp;nbsp;To sometimes go into their heart as their disbelieving-self struggles with their believing-self? Even in His infancy, Jesus awoke in them a longing that some did not even know they had. &amp;nbsp;Come along ~ if you dare ~ on a journey when THEY MET JESUS and the hearts of those who sometimes doubted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get all books in this series on 100 people who met and struggled with Jesus. Book 1 Star Song. &amp;nbsp;Book 2 Dream Maker. &amp;nbsp;Book 3 Hearts Afire. &amp;nbsp;Book 4 Folk Hero. &amp;nbsp;Book 5 Flood Gates. &amp;nbsp;Book 6 Promise Keeper. &amp;nbsp;Book 7 Shadow of Death. &amp;nbsp;Book 8 Come Fly With Me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The author has approached several Hollywood producers about turning this into a weekly TV series.)&lt;br /&gt;

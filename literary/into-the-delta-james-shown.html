  <title>Into the Delta - James Shown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Uhurathe name means freedom in Swahili. But for Captain Nathan Reinhard, its more than just the name of his boat, and his boat is for more than just pleasure.
Being a missionary, as Captain Reinhard had always known, required, at times, being faced with certain dangers. It was danger that led him to the sea to become a missionary, but since that time, he&#39;d encountered nothing more than hostile natives, never before had he actually been face to face with death while in the mission field.
Now as he becomes entangled in the murky waters of Southeast Asia in a daring attempt to rescue the beautiful Su Ling, things change. Not wanting to involve himself in a deadly suicidal mission in the first place, Captain Reinhard draws on every available resource to accomplish his mission, as he travels into the delta." />

  <title>Twilight of a Star - R.J. Revavtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of LuLu Fontaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she was a girl who escaped from a small town in the hills of rural Pennsylvania, and found her way to the bright lights of the big city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she was a girl who parlayed a look and an attitude into a career that thrust her to the top of the often cut-throat world of modeling.  It was her image that graced innumberable magazine covers and captured her one of the industry&#39;s first million dollar modeling contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she was a girl who lived her life in the fast lane, moving from the runways of Milan to the grand mansions of the Hamptons to the night clubs of New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she was a girl who proved herself to be every man&#39;s fantasy and every woman&#39;s envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she was a girl who&#39;s star was extinguished way too early, when she faced her violent end at the hands of a vicious killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now what happened that night has remained shrouded in mystery.  For more than twenty years the secrets have been compounded by the lies, and the truth has been carefully hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth always comes out in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;" />

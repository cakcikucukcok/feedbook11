  <title>Life Is More Than a Job - Sheila Tillman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are countless books focusing on climbing the corporate ladder, but what if you just want to work in a relatively stress-free environment and return home with the satisfaction of a job well done?
Sheila Tillman, who spent almost fifty years in the corporate workplace, wrote this guide to help rank-and-file employees succeed on the job so they can enjoy life outside work. 
In no-nonsense language, she explains what employers want and how to keep them happyeven if you dont want to rise up the ranks. Learn how to:
	leave a job gracefully when you cant grasp the fundamentals of the work;
	determine whether youre a good fit for a particular job; and
	approach each day with a positive, can-do attitude.
Tillman also explains that if you disagree with your most recent job rating, feel that you deserved a raise that you did not get, or think co-workers dont like you, its not a good idea to go to human resources as it will almost always support management.
Discover the unwritten rules of survival in the workplace, and make informed decisions about who you work for and how with the lessons in Life Is More than a Job." />

  <title>The Gorilla Game, Revised Edition - Geoffrey A. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Possibilities Are Staggering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had you invested $10,000 in Cisco Systems back in early 1990, your investment would now be worth $3,650,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a $10,000 investment made in Microsoft in 1986 would be valued at more than $4,721,000 today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$10,000 invested in Yahoo! in 1996 would today be worth $317,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you get in on those deals&amp;#8212;especially if you&#39;re not a Silicon Valley insider? How do you buy the high-tech win-ners and avoid the losers? How do you find the Yahoo!s, Microsofts, and Ciscos of tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers are here, in this newly revised edition of the national bestseller The Gorilla Game. The book reveals the dynamics driving the market for high-tech stocks and out-lines the forces that catapult a select number of compa-nies to &quot;gorilla&quot; status&amp;#8212;dominating the markets they serve in the way that Yahoo! dominates internet portals, Microsoft dominates software operating systems, and Cisco dominates hardware for data networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the rules of The Gorilla Game and you will learn how to identify and invest in the &quot;gorilla candidates&quot; early on&amp;#8212;while they are still fighting for dominance, and while their stocks are still cheap. When the dust clears and one company clearly attains leadership in its market, you&#39;ll reap the enormous returns that foresighted investors in high-tech companies deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new edition of The Gorilla Game has been updated and revised throughout, with new focus and new insights into choosing the internet gorillas&amp;#8212;the companies that are destined to dominate internet commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Geoffrey A. Moore is one of the world&#39;s leading consultants in high-tech marketing strategy. Here you&#39;ll find his groundbreaking ideas about tech-nology markets that made his previous books bestsellers, combined with the work of Paul Johnson, a top Wall Street technology analyst, and Tom Kippola, a high-tech consul-tant and highly successful private investor. Together they have discovered and played the gorilla game and now give readers the real rules for winning in the world of high-tech investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step by step you&#39;ll learn how to spot a high-tech market that is about to undergo rapid growth and development, how to identify and spread investments across the potential gorillas within the market, and how to narrow your investments to the single, emerging leader&amp;#8212;the gorilla&amp;#8212;as the market matures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-tech investing can be extremely risky, but investors who learn to play the gorilla game can avoid many of the traps and pitfalls and instead start capitalizing on untold profits. Personal wealth is only a gorilla game away.&lt;/p&gt;" />

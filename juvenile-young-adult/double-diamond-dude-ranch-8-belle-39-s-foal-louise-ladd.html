  <title>Double Diamond Dude Ranch #8 - Belle&#39;s Foal - Louise Ladd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It seems like it&#39;s taken forever, but Chris&#39;s horse Belle is finally ready to give birth to her foal. Chris is so anxious that she&#39;s decided to move into the barn. After all, Belle&#39;s foal is just about the biggest event in Chris&#39;s life! She only wishes she had someone to share her excitement with. But lately her best friends, Drew and Serena, have been spending all their time together. All they ever want to do is hang out with each other--never with Chris--or talk on the phone, or hold hands. How can they be so selfish? she wonders. It&#39;s as if Chris doesn&#39;t even exist anymore. But when there&#39;s trouble at the Double Diamond Dude Ranch--and Chris must turn to someone for help--she learns a valuable lesson about who her friends really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss other exciting Chris adventures, from Louise Ladd!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

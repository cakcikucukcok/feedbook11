  <title>Blind Acceptance - Sandra Pimentel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The evolution of a marriage of true partners maturing and changing, grappling with personal and family issues, plays out before a backdrop of the social and political upheaval of the latter half of the 20th century, bringing surprises, challenges, and blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Blind Acceptance&lt;/i&gt;, the author experiences a metamorphosis as she confronts the realities of war, racism, and the cultural changes for women of her time. With an innate sense of our inter-connectedness and an unwavering trust in humankind, the author and her steadfastly supportive and delightfully irreverent husband perpetuate a family legacy of caring for others without reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;IN PRAISE OF &lt;i&gt;BLIND ACCEPTANCE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Pimentel&#39;s new book, &lt;i&gt;Blind Acceptance&lt;/i&gt;, is so well written and packed with
twists and turns that it reads more like a novel than a memoir. Throughout the text she weaves the through line of her life  live abundantly, love fully, and be an active participant in life. I believe her story will capture your heart; it did mine.&lt;br&gt;
 Mache Seibel, MD, Author of the best-selling book The Estrogen Window&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Pimentel&#39;s searingly honest memoir takes readers on a journey through a fascinating life dedicated to compassion, creativity, and--above all--family.&lt;br&gt;
 John H. Kennedy, Boston University lecturer and former Boston Globe journalist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Pimentel, a young woman from an Italian working-class family, actively participating in community organizations, becomes ever more aware and angry over racial and social inequalities in American society. Blind Acceptance is a tribute to the enduring human spirit. Ms. Pimentel&#39;s unconditional acceptance encompasses the multitudes fortunate enough to venture into her warm and welcoming orbit.&lt;br&gt;
 Jewelle Taylor Gibbs, PhD, Author of &lt;i&gt;Destiny&#39;s Child&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blind Acceptance&lt;/i&gt; captures the story of Sandy Pimentel, caught between the generation of women expected to toe the line and the next generation who demanded that the feminine voice be heard. Driven by her reliable natural instinct, Sandy blew past all the norms once dictated by family, religion, and the status quo.&lt;br&gt;

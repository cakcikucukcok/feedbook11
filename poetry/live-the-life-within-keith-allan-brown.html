  <title>Live the Life Within - Keith Allan Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poem by Keith Allan Brown
Walking with GOD
When you walk with GOD, you walk on air,
When you walk with GOD, you dont have a care,
When you walk with GOD, the path is straight,
When you walk with GOD, trust in HIM not fate.
When you walk with GOD, theres nothing to fear,
When you walk with GOD, HEll keep you near,
When you walk with GOD, Youll feed from above,
When you walk with GOD, Youre filled with love.
When you walk with GOD, the way is clear,
When you walk with GOD, you wont shed a tear,
When you walk with GOD, your worries will cease,
When you walk with GOD, youll be at peace.
When you walk with GOD, youre never late,
When you walk with GOD, HE opens the gate,
When you walk with GOD, HE frees your mind,
When you walk with GOD, Happiness youll find.
When you walk with GOD, youre free of worry,
When you walk with GOD, theres no need to hurry,
When you walk with GOD, in HIS good time,
When you walk with GOD, all from HIM are mine.
After reading this book, listening to the music and lyrics of the 20 songs on the two CDs and reading the 20 Poems you may just be about to find out, as Ragnhild Anita and John from Norway did, that you can be in control of your inner life. We all have lessons to learn and Ragnhild Anita and John confirmed this to me by way of some comments they gave me shortly after reading some pre-published text and listening to the songs. Their comments, I think describe their thought process in just three stages of understanding. The first was one of uncertainty in that they said The Inner Life seemed too good to be true; their second stage process was one of possibility in that they said If it is possible to Live The Life Within then it must be a miracle; their third and final conclusion was one of acknowledgement in that they said To Live The Life Within you must to go away from noise, worries and concerns and dare to be alone and listen to your inner voice. Pray to GOD that he will show you the way." />

  <title>Don&#39;t Read This Book - Donald Roos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of our ideas never see the light of day. Why? If you ask a creative person, the answer will always revolve around time. Don&#39;t Read This Book focuses on how to make choices about everything you do in your daily creative practice and life. It’s not about a minimalist way to spend and organize your creative time as Hemingway with twitter, it’s not even to be as synthetic as you can in your to-do lists so that procrastination is taken into consideration without provoking late afternoon regrets. It’s about too many characters in this sentence as there isn’t time for everything. It’s actually Less = Less. To Do Lists are actually too many times a naive knowledge about yourself (birthday and new year resolutions are a painful reminder of this reality). The main message of this book is Focus. It connects the decisions you make at a personal, professional and creative level. It’s a reminder of how management of time is essential to complete your project and how being dispersed around too many ideas can make you lose time." />

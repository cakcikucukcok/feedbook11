  <title>The Meaning of Surah 01 Al-Fatihah (The Opening) ???????? From Holy Quran (????????? ?????) Bilingual Edition - Jannah Firdaus Mediapro, Джанна Фирдаус Медиапро</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surah al-Fati?ah (Arabic: ??????? ???????????&amp;lrm;) is the first chapter (surah) of The Holy Quran. Its seven verses (ayat) are a prayer for the guidance, lordship and mercy of Allah SWT(God). This chapter has an essential role in Islamic prayer (sal?t). The primary literal meaning of the expression &amp;quot;al-Fati?ah&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;The Opener,&amp;quot; which could refer to this Surah being &amp;quot;the opener of the Book&amp;quot; (Fati?at al-kitab), to its being the first Surah recited in full in every prayer cycle (rak?ah), or to the manner in which it serves as an opening for many functions in everyday Islamic life. Some Muslims interpret it as a reference to an implied ability of the Surah to open a person to faith in God.&lt;br /&gt;
The name al-Fati?ah (&amp;quot;the Opener&amp;quot;) is due to the subject-matter of the surah. Fati?ah is that which opens a subject or a book or any other thing. In other words, a sort of preface.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The word ??????? came from the root word ??? which means to open, explain, disclose, keys of treasure etc. That means sura Al-Fatiha is the summary of the whole Quran. That is why we recite another Ayat or sura along with Fatiha in our prayers. That is, sura Al-Fatiha is paired with rest of the whole Quran. It is also called Umm Al-Kitab (&amp;quot;the Mother of the Book&amp;quot;) and Umm Al-Quran (&amp;quot;the Mother of the Quran&amp;quot;); Sab&amp;#39;a al Mathani (&amp;quot;Seven repeated [verses]&amp;quot;, an appellation taken from verse 15:87 of the Quran); Al-Hamd (&amp;quot;praise&amp;quot;), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said that God says: &amp;quot;The prayer [al-Fati?ah] is divided into two halves between Me and My servants. When the servant says, &amp;#39;All praise is due to God&amp;#39;, the Lord of existence, God says, &amp;#39;My servant has praised Me&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;; Al-Shifa&amp;#39; (&amp;quot;the Cure&amp;quot;), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said: &amp;quot;The Opening of the Book is a cure for every poison.&amp;quot;, Al-Ruqyah (&amp;quot;remedy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spiritual cure&amp;quot;)., and al-Asas, &amp;quot;The Foundation&amp;quot;, referring to its serving as a foundation for the entire Quran.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surah Al-Fati?ah is often believed to be a synthesis of The Holy Quran. It in itself is a prayer at the very beginning of the Quran, which acts as a preface of the Quran and implies that the book is for a person who is a seeker of truth&amp;mdash;a reader who is asking a deity who is the only one worthy of all praise (and is the creator, owner, sustainer of the worlds etc.) to guide him to a straight path. It can be said to &amp;quot;encapsulate all of the metaphysical and eschatological realities of which human beings must remain conscious.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

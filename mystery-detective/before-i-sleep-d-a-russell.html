  <title>Before I Sleep - D. A. Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Six years after he was thought to have died, the most feared terrorist in the world has made his presence known once again, spotted in a small town north of Boston. Just knowing that he is alive is enough to shake the White House to the core, for the handful cleared to know realizes that a terrorist strike like nothing the United States has ever seen is now inevitable.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The man known as the Falconer is no simple, crazed fanantic; he does not make mistakes. His plans reshaped history and toppled governments, and his supposed death was celebrated by a dozen governments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the past, Rob Stephens was the only person who could match up against Falconer. Now, with the terrorist back, he is forced to leave the quiet hills of New Hampshire and return to the fray. To succeed, he must again become something he hates-the Falconer&#39;s equal.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this riveting thriller, the peaceful life Stephens once knew seems a lifetime awat as he realizes that saving the President, and the averting a global wave of terrorism, depends only on him.&lt;/P&gt;" />

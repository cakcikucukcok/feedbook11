  <title>Historical Dictionary of the Cold War - Joseph Smith, Simon Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cold war&amp;rdquo; was a term coined in 1945 by left-leaning British writer George Orwell to predict how powers made unconquerable by having nuclear weapons would conduct future relations. It was popularized in 1947 by American journalist Walter Lippmann amid mounting tensions between the erstwhile World War II Allies - the capitalist democracies - the United States of America and Britain - versus the Soviet Union, a communist dictatorship. As the grand alliance of the &amp;ldquo;Big Three&amp;rdquo; they had defeated Nazi Germany, its satellites and Japan in World War II but became rivals who split the world into an American-led Western &amp;ldquo;bloc&amp;rdquo; and Soviet-led Eastern &amp;ldquo;bloc.&amp;rdquo; Both were secured from direct attack by arraying ever-greater nuclear and conventional forces against the other while seeking global supremacy by other means. The 45-year Cold War lasted until the Soviet Union collapsed between 1989 and 1991.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This second edition of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Historical Dictionary of the Cold War &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;contains a chronology, an introduction, and an extensive bibliography. The dictionary section has over 400 cross-referenced entries on important personalities, crucial countries and peripheral conflicts, the increasingly lethal weapons systems, and the various political and military strategies. This book is an excellent resource for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more about this crucial period in history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

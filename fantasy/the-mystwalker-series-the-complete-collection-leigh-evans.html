  <title>The Mystwalker Series, The Complete Collection - Leigh Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enter the magical world of the Mystwalker series with the full e-book collection: T&lt;i&gt;he Trouble with Fate, The Thing About Weres, The Problem with Promises, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Danger of Destiny&lt;/i&gt; from Leigh Evans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Hedi Peacock and I have a secret. I&#39;m not human, and I have the pointy Fae ears and Were inner-bitch to prove it. As fairy tales go, my childhood was damn near perfect, all fur and magic until a werewolf  killed my father and the Fae executed my mother. I&#39;ve never forgiven either side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Trouble with Fate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today I&#39;m a half-breed barista working at a fancy coffee house, living with my loopy Aunt Lou and a temperamental amulet named Merry, and wondering where in the world I&#39;m going in life. But when a pack of Weres decides to kidnap my aunt and force me to steal &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; amulet, the only one who can help me is the last person I ever thought I&#39;d turn to: Robson Trowbridge. He was a part-time werewolf, a full-time bastard, and  the first and only boy I ever loved. That is, until he became the prime suspect in my father&#39;s death...And he&#39;s as annoyingly beautiful as I  remember. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Thing About Weres&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since I shoved Trowbridge through the Gates of Merenwyn, I&#39;ve been the leader of the Creemore pack-hard to believe, right? The thing is: I&#39;m still half-Fae. To make matters worse, the wolves of Creemore want my blood-and the North American Council of Weres wants me dead. So I&#39;m just  counting the days until Trowbridge returns from the other realm...and comes to my brave rescue...and becomes my alpha mate. Wishful thinking? Of course it is. But given all the mess I&#39;ve been through already, what&#39;s the harm in doing a little bit of daisy-plucking? Besides, Trowbridge owes me bigtime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Problem with Promises&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is, my past is pretty messy and bad guys keep knocking down my door. Witches, thug bikers, the North American Council of Weres, dark  magic Fae, and even an evil wizard are all after me. The Old Mage is the only one I really care about: He has my dear twin brother captive on the other side of the Gates of Merenwyn--not cool. Unfortunately, everyone who helps me ends up in a heap of trouble too--including my Trowbridge. Now, I admit I&#39;ve had my moments as a shivering coward, hoping he will come to my brave rescue. The whole Prince Charming thing  is hard to shake. But these bad guys after me mean business and those damsel in distress days are over. You know that &quot;last straw&quot; metaphor?&lt;i&gt; That was two straws ago. &lt;/i&gt;It&#39;s now or never. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Danger of Destiny&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;There are very few days off when you&#39;re on an epic quest. Believe me, I know. My twin brother is being held captive by the Old Mage in another realm. Lo and behold, as soon as Trowbridge and I arrive in Merenwyn, we&#39;re separated in spectacular, dramatic fashion-and I&#39;m left to figure out how to maintain the fragile balance between my Fae magic and my wolf&#39;s blood in a realm that cries to both. Not easy, particularly when I&#39;m keeping an iron-grip on my temper so as not to dispatch with extreme prejudice the odd wizard or smart-mouthed mutt servant who crosses my path. My mama never told me there&#39;d be days like these, but I&#39;m not going down without a fight...or my mate.&lt;/p&gt;" />

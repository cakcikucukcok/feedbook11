      <meta name="description" content="One-Act Plays for School and Theatre is dedicated to children of all ages. This fountainhead of its kind inspires a new way of seeing and saying. Its a journey for students to theater kingdom with themes that are topical the world over.
A string of eight plays is categorized for each age group comprising of 811, 1214, and 1517 years. This helps the theater person to put in minimum efforts for selection and presentation of the play with the appropriate age group of children. Hence plays for the first group focus on their curiosity and imagination (i.e., thinking skills) and being able to communicate. The most sensitive age group, 1214, interacts with the world around. They are given enough space to create and construct the script and also to innovate on the stage. With their collaborative skills, they confidently initiate smooth changes without disturbing the theme.
In the third group, the young adult Naturals to the core are allowed to own interactive ability. The young adult is ready to execute in an eloquent voice and commanding stage presence. They learn from each other while analyzing characters and story elements that focus on social causes, thereby creating and shaping relationships that are therapeutic." />

  <title>Past Due - William Lashner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It means something to be a client. It means he gets my loyalty, whether he deserves it or not. It means he gets my absolute best for the price of an hourly fee. It means in a world where every person has turned against him there is one person who will fight by his side for as long as there is a battle to be fought.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212;Victor Carl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author of the acclaimed novels &lt;em&gt;Fatal Flaw&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bitter Truth&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Hostile Witness&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling writer William Lashner crafts dark, witty, engrossing tales of suspense involving one of the most intriguing characters of modern popular fiction: Victor Carl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defense attorney who lives his life in shades of gray, Victor Carl fights all the right fights for all the wrong reasons. With a failing legal practice, a dead-end love life, a pile of unpaid traffic tickets, and a talent for mixing it up in tough working-class bars and sparring with obstinate cops, Victor skates on the razor&#39;s edge of legal ethics in search of the easy buck. But the one absolute in Victor&#39;s life is loyalty, especially to a client&amp;#8212;even if he happens to be dead. Like Joey Cheaps, a no-account who takes a knife to the throat down on the waterfront, but not before he shares with his lawyer his part in a terrible crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his client murdered, Victor must search for a killer. But solving the crime means investigating the darkest spot in Joey Cheaps&#39;s misspent youth, sending Victor on a twisting journey that leads to a missing suitcase stuffed with money, photographs of a mysterious naked woman, and a Supreme Court justice with a secret to hide. And most dangerous of all, Victor steps into the crosshairs of a vengeful enemy with a past full of pain and a taste for blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As thrilling as it is darkly evocative, &lt;em&gt;Past Due&lt;/em&gt; is a superb tale of crime and justice that takes the intrepid Victor Carl into brilliant new territory and confirms William Lashner&#39;s place among the top suspense writers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />

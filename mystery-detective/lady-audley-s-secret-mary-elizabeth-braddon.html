  <title>Lady Audley’s Secret - Mary Elizabeth Braddon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Lady Audley&amp;rsquo;s Secret&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been called &amp;quot;the most sensationally successful of all the sensational novels&amp;quot;. The success of the book, along with Mary Elizabeth Braddon&amp;#39;s other bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Aurora Floyd&lt;/i&gt;, established the author as the main rival of the master of the sensational novel, Wilkie Collins. A protest against the passive, insipid 19th-century heroine, Lady Audley was described by one critic of the time as &amp;quot;high-strung, full of passion, purpose, and movement.&amp;quot; Her crime (the secret of the title) is shown to threaten the apparently respectable middle-class world of Victorian England. The story centres on &amp;quot;accidental bigamy&amp;quot; which was in literary fashion in the early 1860s. The plot was summarised by literary critic Elaine Showalter (1982): &amp;quot;Braddon&amp;#39;s bigamous heroine deserts her child, pushes husband number one down a well, thinks about poisoning husband number two and sets fire to a hotel in which her other male acquaintances are residing&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elements of the novel mirror themes of the real-life Constance Kent case of June 1860 which gripped the nation for years. The follow-up novel &lt;i&gt;(Aurora Floyd) &lt;/i&gt;appeared in 1863. There have been three silent film adaptations, one UK television version in 2000, and three minor stage adaptations." />

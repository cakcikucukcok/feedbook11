  <title>Death List - Edwin F. Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When incurable pedophiles are released into our society, does it give you comfort knowing where they live? That isif they bother to register. It is only circumstance that allows some dying senior citizens to realize they are exempt from the penalties associated with making the sex offender registry their Death List! Targeting the worst of the worst, they decide to make the world a bit safer for the children. In their rationale, even if they are caught, they will be dead before they are sentenced. This group of flawed, unhappy Baby Boomers, made up by a cast of very different characters decides that if the law itself is broken, then breaking the law does not apply. This is a very original story that incorporates many aspects that this gray generation is faced with, as well as their personal feelings, which transition as they bond in a common cause. Make no mistake, this is a violent book. No one is spared, as this heinous disease has spread to those in the most respected positions. The solution? Personal justice dealt out in large doses. Think about it. If a tiger was loose in your city, what kind of response would it bring from those in authority? Yet an incurable pedophile can be a multiple offender and living next door to you. The characters in this book are tired of watching the heinous crimes against children on the news. They realize they are immune from punishment, which for some offers a chance at redemption. This book also offers a glimpse of the world from the perspective of those that are a lost generation. Losing their jobs to younger workers and without insurance, stuck at an age where they are too young for government benefits, and recipients of the separation syndrome that has affected so many families. These are grandparents that refuse to accept that their grandchildren could become prey to these predators. Expect the unexpected, as they proceed with assistance and divine intervention.  This book should make you cheer, laugh, think and even shed a tear. The first book marketing person that read this work, called me to say it was in chapter two that he went online to find the 15 sex offenders lived with a two mile radius of his home. I have two little girls! he told me. I hope it makes some people aware and more protective of their children. I hope it causes some to write or call these judges that put these incurables back into our society. Given the proliferation of these crimes, this book may contain the only possible solution and become prophetic." />

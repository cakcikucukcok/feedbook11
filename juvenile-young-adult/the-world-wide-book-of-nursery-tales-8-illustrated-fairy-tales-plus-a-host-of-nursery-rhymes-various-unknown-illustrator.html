  <title>THE WORLD-WIDE BOOK OF NURSERY TALES - 8 illustrated Fairy Tales plus a host of Nursery Rhymes - Various, Unknown Illustrator</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Publishers offer in this volume well known and long loved and extremely well illustrated stories to their young readers. These tales have had delighted the children of many generations and will be equally welcome in the nurseries of the present day, which, with the popularity and antiquity of the contents of the volume, justify them in styling it The World-Wide Nursery Book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But why a &amp;quot;World-Wide book of Nursery Tales?&amp;quot; Take the story of Cinderella for example&amp;hellip;..Many people believe this was written by the Grimm Brothers, but you would be incorrect. Charles Perrault (1628 - 1703) had identified, translated and published the tale of Cinderella at least 50 years before the Grimm Brothers translated the tale from French into German.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is still debate as to whether the story originated in ancient Egypt or China. In ancient Egypt a fragment of a papyrus records a part of the story which is titled The Lost Sandal. There are also fragments of recordings in ancient China. It is believed it then migrated West as trade between the East and West increased. There is also debate as to whether it originated in China and made its way to Egypt along trade routes before crossing the Middle East and arriving in Europe to become the tale we know today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So who wrote the original? The answer is simple. No-one knows, and its true author and country of origin are never likely to be known, but it is certainly a story with world-wide origins as are most of the stories in this book. Hence, we believe the name is fitting.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories in this book are:&lt;br /&gt;
Red Riding-Hood.&lt;br /&gt;
Puss-In-Boots.&lt;br /&gt;
Mother Hubbard.&lt;br /&gt;
Cock Robin&amp;#39;s Death.&lt;br /&gt;
Jack And Bean-Stalk.&lt;br /&gt;
Tom Thumb.&lt;br /&gt;
Cinderella.&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Bears.&lt;br /&gt;
Punch And Judy &lt;i&gt;Removed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Pets.&lt;br /&gt;
Nursery Songs.&lt;br /&gt;
Nursery Rhymes.&lt;br /&gt;
Nursery Ditties.&lt;br /&gt;
Nursery Tales.&lt;br /&gt;
Nursery Jingles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 112 colour illustrations in the classic style bring added life to the tales and rhymes enabling younger children to visuaise the story being told.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
PUBLISHER&amp;rsquo;S NOTE: The original publication of this book included the nursery rhyme &amp;ldquo;Punch and Judy&amp;rdquo;. Due to the propagation of domestic violence and themes of gratuitous violence which result in death, the publisher has not deemed this poem suitable for children, nor adults, and have elected to remove it from this book.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this eBook will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;

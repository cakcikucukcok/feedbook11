          &lt;strong&gt;Wedlocked! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A runaway wife Alix North had fallen in love with Rhys Stirling the first time she had met him. Now Alix&#39;s dream was about to come true - Rhys had asked her to marry him. Rhys Stirling was an ambitious man, and the only thing that stood between him and a directorship was his single status. Of course, that was easily remedied.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;d known Alix all his life - she was the perfect choice. Alix isn&#39;t going to accept anything less than his love. It&#39;s only after Alix leaves him that Rhys finds that he&#39;s fallen in love - with his own wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ms. Wentworth&#39;s talented writing comes through… &quot; - &lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

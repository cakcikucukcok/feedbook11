  <title>Pulpy and Midge - Jessica Westhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Lembeck &amp;#150; &amp;#145;Pulpy&amp;#8217; &amp;#150; takes life slow and steady. He likes his office job, and he likes his gentle, figurine-collecting boss, Al. He even likes the bitter receptionist, though he&amp;#8217;s the only one who does. He likes his wife, Midge, too, and their ice-dancing lessons. Midge works as a candle-party hostess &amp;#150; she quit her office job when Al&amp;#8217;s dog ate her pet pigeon and Al promised Pulpy a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Al retires and the tyrannical Dan takes over, the promotion vanishes. And then Dan&amp;#8217;s oversexed wife, Beatrice, takes a shine to Pulpy, and Dan starts to think Midge is one hot tamale. Soon, the receptionist is smitten with Pulpy, Midge can&amp;#8217;t get rid of Dan and Beatrice, and Pulpy&amp;#8217;s job is in jeopardy. For once, Pulpy just might have to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

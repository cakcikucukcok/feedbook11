  <title>The Horror - Eli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eli is a name given to Mark Germine at the time of his revelation from the God of Abraham in 1996. As such revelation makes him a prophet, he is the Prophet Eli. He had published one previous book, the Book of Eli (2011). He continues to prophesize about possibilities in the future, and many of his prophecies have already come to pass, in particular the times of trouble and danger, which began on September 11, 2001, with the demolition of the Twin Towers and other atrocities.
Eli foresees a great worldwide calamity relating to future breakdown of the economy in the near future, for which we must prepare. Only by forsaking usury, totally and as soon as possible, can this calamity be averted. Our future may be as unfavorable as human extinction, but beyond this, Eli foresees a time of peace, universal love, world harmony, and paradise or heaven on earth for those who can perceive it. This will happen when we go back to our former state as represented in the mythos by the Garden of Eden and prior to the Fall of Lucifer.
As a psychiatrist and theologian, Eli attributes the Fall to the development of an alter-ego identity as against the true ego, united with the soul. The Fall is at the root of psychopathic behavior that is now out of control in government, business, and elsewhere. This theme is developed broadly in this book to search for the mastermind of 9/11 and others involved.
God gave Eli the mission of unveiling the events of 9/11 and using his knowledge as a psychiatrist to unveil the mastermind of 9/11 and other psychopaths in the United States who made it happen, and this is the underlying structure of this book. Eli remains a seer who has insight into hidden knowledge, giving him a special qualification to go about this work.
Eli is otherwise an ordinary human being and not a messiah or demigod. He is neither perfect norr infallible. He has chosen the road of compassion and love for all of humankind, as revealed to him beginning in 1996. Before this, in 1977, he was given a vision of heaven on earth with the passing of his mother. 
Heaven on earth already exists, but people do not see it (Gospel of Thomas). This perception is critical to the future of humankind. Hell, the Horror, is always with us in its perception by humans but falls when this perception is abandoned. A new human being then inhabits a new world. Humankind will become One in love.
Eli teaches the unity of all major world religions and science and, as a scientist, does not believe in the supernatural but, rather, a universe based on the experience in the One Mind or God. Gods choice is in a universe of infinite possibilities, as held in Elis interpretation of the One Mind Model in quantum physics." />

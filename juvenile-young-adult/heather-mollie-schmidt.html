  <title>Heather - Mollie Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I loved it! I read the whole thing in under 3 hours! My favorite part was when Heather was feeding Sugar the medicine, and it had to be mixed with apple sauce. I loved the story. The plot was awesome! The way you described everything helped me picture it in my head. The part about Heather and the girl who hit the deer was sad, but I liked it. I also loved how at the end you said the air was crisp and smelled of apples. I could so imagine being there!&lt;br&gt;
Jewel Forman, age 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself laughing out loud while reading this wonderful book! I believe any young girl will be able to find a kinship with Heather on some level. Thank you for bringing back memories that will now forever be in print for so many to enjoy!&lt;br&gt;
Rosalie Myron, stable owner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a book about the last year of high school for a teenager in a single-parent family with many responsibilities to shoulder, Heather is a link to a life in rural Maine filled with friends, family members, and horses to love and care for. As an expert on the public health issues of children and adults, I value Heather as a book that is wholesome, informative, and fun for young readers.&lt;br&gt;

  <title>The Mighty Quinns: Devin (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (The Mighty Quinns, Book 28) - Kate Hoffmann</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;What was forbidden then… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;has become irresistible now&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last thing police chief Devin Cassidy needs is for Elodie Winchester to return home and remind him of all he&#39;s been denied. But they&#39;re not teenagers now, and she&#39;s no longer a wealthy heiress. There&#39;s nothing stopping him from taking what he wants, what he&#39;s always wanted: her. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elodie came home to deal with the Winchester mansion, the only inheritance she has left. She didn&#39;t expect to encounter a very grown-up Dev, or to want him as much as she ever did. He makes it clear that he&#39;s not going to let anything stand between them again. But in this town, name is everything. And to protect a Winchester, Dev will be forced to sacrifice his reputation…including his unexpected tie to the Quinn family.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Living Without Worry - J.R. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living Without Worry is one book of J.R Miller author.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One meets few unworried people. Most faces bear lines of care. Men go anxious to their day&amp;#39;s duties, rush through the hours with feverish speed, and bring a hot brain and tumultuous pulse home at night for restless, unrefreshing sleep. This is not only most unsatisfactory, but is also a most costly mode of living.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Worry exhausts vitality. True, all good in life costs. Virtue goes out of us in everything we do that is worth doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal theory of life is, therefore, work without worry. At least, this certainly ought to be the ideal for a Christian. We have an express command not to be anxious about anything. Our whole duty is to do the will of God and leave in his hands the outworking of circumstances, the shaping and overhauling of all the complicated network of influences, so as to bring about the right results.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The working plan for a Christian life is clearly laid down in our Lord&amp;#39;s words: &amp;quot;Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today&amp;#39;s trouble is enough for today.&amp;quot; This ideal leaves no place whatever for worry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is all the human part. Then God will look after the outcome; will take care of us and of the results of our acts. It is the function of faith, when we have done what we can, to put all into the divine hands, giving ourselves no anxiety, while we go forward in peace and confidence to the next duty that awaits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book has a message of faith and comfort for your soul.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

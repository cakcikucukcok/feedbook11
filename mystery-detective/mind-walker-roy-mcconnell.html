  <title>Mind Walker - Roy McConnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For more than four hundred years, the males of the Ostermann family have unleashed their secret power on the world, destroying lives and amassing great fortunes. But five centuries prior, the first woman to inherit the identical gene as the males foretold that another female would be born with the same power. It was she who would stand against the madness of the Ostermann reign. No one knew when she would comeuntil now.&lt;p&gt;
In present-day British Columbia, Wolf Ostermann rules his exotic estate with an iron fist. Ostermann has no son to continue his family legacy, so if he and his family are to maintain their economic grip on the world, Wolf must indoctrinate his reluctant daughter, Tara. Unfortunately for Wolf, Tara will have nothing to do with him anymore, and that doesnt bode well for the tyrannical megalomaniac.&lt;p&gt;
Now on the run, Tara and ex-CIA operative Chris Landry must battle for their lives as they ultimately realize the tenacious reach of her fathers powerful mindand the evil it unleashes on all of humanity.&lt;p&gt;
Bursting with raw emotion, &lt;i&gt;Mind Walker&lt;/i&gt; combines action and suspense in a nonstop ride from the landscapes of British Columbia to the Caribbean Islands, and ends in a chilling climax in New York City." />

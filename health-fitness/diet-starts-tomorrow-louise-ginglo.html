  <title>Diet Starts Tomorrow - Louise Ginglo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Diet starts tomorrow. Those three words come out of our mouths more often that we would like. Ruby is fed up with constantly dieting, focusing on losing a large amount of weight, just to look good and get into a pair of skinny jeans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with the decision of wanting to be healthy, Ruby begins sessions with Crystala healthy lifestyle coach. The sessions with Crystal prove to Ruby that there is more to becoming healthy than walking away with a menu plan to follow and weekly weigh-ins. She discovers it has more to do with embracing the path of a healthy lifestyle and what goes on in her mind while she is progressing through it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow Ruby on her journey to living a new, healthy lifestyle. Along the way, she learns how important it is to love and respect herself as well as discovering what she is capable of, and how all of this is more important than the number on a set of scales or on the label of that little black dress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never know, Ruby may just motivate you to do the same for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

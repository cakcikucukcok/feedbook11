  <title>A Boy from Flakkee - Roland Krygsman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roland Krygsman, AKA Roeland Krijgsman, was born on the island of Goeree-OverFlakkee on December 15, 1928 in the town of Middleharnis, The Netherlands. From the Great Depression, to the Second World War, life was always a struggle. As he grew up, he would ultimately carve out his own path and establish his own roots. Through his many adventures on the island to immigrating to America, he
persevered through it all. He and his wife Lena settled in a town known as Clifton, New Jersey and currently live in the Dutch Hill section of that town. His story was originally left for his children and grandchildren. However his story was so extradinary, he felt it should be shared with the world. Each day is a gift. His hope is that many will appreciate what they have, rather than what they dont have. Life is about family; protecting it, nurturing it, and encouragement for growth. If hes not walking his four legged companion Max, hell be at his work bench dissecting some electrical motor or something else for scrap. Most of his days are uneventful. His highlights are time with his children and grandchildren when they visit Oma and Opa. When given the opportunity, he still to this day shares his stories with neighbors, and those who pass by while sitting on his front porch with his devoted friend Max. Ask him about his life? Well, you better sit down with a cup of coffee in hand and are prepared to listen till he cant remember
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Sincerely with Love,
&lt;br&gt;Herbert Krygsman" />

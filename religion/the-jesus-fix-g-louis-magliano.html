  <title>The Jesus Fix - G. Louis Magliano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The streets were cold and heartless. A harsh reality that surrounded those caught in its terrible grip. There seemed to be no end. No mercy. Every sort of evil lurked around every corner. Every one was looking for the next fix. Some glimmer of hope that would sustain them through another day. A small mission called simply The Center was a small light in the dark. A place of safety. A haven for kids looking for an escape from the dark. The Center offered something new. A fix that lasted. Not a temporary high or buzz. The Center offered salvation. Salvation from the death that was on the street. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Pastor Lelon and Father Rayne went into the dark to bring hope to those who were lost. There were so many kids. Drugs and alcohol were as common as soft drinks. Violence ruled and money was the bottom line. The job seemed impossible but with God all things are possible. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The answer was simple. Faith and trust in God. Armed with these the men would be successful but when the enemies fiery darts came would they be able to stand firm or would these men of God fall? There were no half measures. It was an all out battle for each soul and there could only be one victor. It all came down, as always, to choices. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />

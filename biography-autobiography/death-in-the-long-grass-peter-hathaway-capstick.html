  <title>Death in the Long Grass - Peter Hathaway Capstick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As thrilling as any novel, as taut and exciting as any adventure story, Peter Hathaway Capstick&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Death in the Long Grass&lt;/i&gt; takes us deep into the heart of darkness to view Africa through the eyes of one of the most renowned professional hunters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few men can say they have known Africa as Capstick has known it--leading safaris through lion country; tracking man-eating leopards along tangled jungle paths; running for cover as fear-maddened elephants stampede in all directions. And of the few who have known this dangerous way of life, fewer still can recount their adventures with the flair of this former professional hunter-turned-writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Capstick&#39;s own experiences and the personal accounts of his colleagues, &lt;i&gt;Death in the Long Grass&lt;/i&gt;portrays the great killers of the African bush--not only the lion, leopard, and elephant, but the primitive rhino and the crocodile waiting for its unsuspecting prey, the titanic hippo and the Cape buffalo charging like an express train out of control. Capstick was a born raconteur whose colorful descriptions and eye for exciting, authentic detail bring us face to face with some of the most ferocious killers in the world--underrated killers like the surprisingly brave and cunning hyena, silent killers such as the lightning-fast black mamba snake, collective killers like the wild dog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers can lean back in a chair, sip a tall, iced drink, and revel in the kinds of hunting stories Hemingway and Ruark used to hear in hotel bars from Nairobi to Johannesburg, as veteran hunters would tell of what they heard beyond the campfire and saw through the sights of an express rifle.&lt;/p&gt;" />

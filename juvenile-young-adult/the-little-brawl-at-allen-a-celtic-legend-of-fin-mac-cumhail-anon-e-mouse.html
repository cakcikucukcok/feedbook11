  <title>THE LITTLE BRAWL AT ALLEN – A Celtic Legend of Fin Mac Cumhail - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 308&lt;br /&gt;
In this 308th&amp;nbsp; issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Irish fairy tale &amp;ldquo;THE LITTLE BRAWL AT ALLEN&amp;rdquo; - A Legend of Finn Mac Cumhail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Goll mac Morna, the most renowned member of clann-Morna, attends a feast with the other Fianna. He insults his captain, Fionn, by giving gifts to the bards and entertainers more lavish than those offered by Fionn Mac Cumhail. Fionn asks where he acquired so much wealth. Goll recounts that he obtained it on campaign in Lochlann, where he killed not only the men of Lochlann but also Fionn&amp;#39;s father.&lt;br /&gt;
But what happens next? Does Fionn take exception to Goll&amp;rsquo;s boasts about Goll killing his father, which would only prove how hot-headed he is, or is his response more measured, like that of a true warrior-king? You&amp;#39;re invited to download and read this story to find out what Finn did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>The Practice of Self Enquiry - Anil Sharma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anil Sharma in his book The Practice of Self Enquiry has come out with a detailed exposition on the teachings of his guru Sage Sri Ramana In December 1993 the author of this book Sri Anil Sharma experienced the rising of cosmic currents in his body- a result of which for the next seven years he experienced the various states of higher consciousness. This book is a dedication to his satguru Sri Ramana Maharshi.Maharshi especially for people who are seeking enlightenment and making an effort to know the various concepts pertaining to birth-death-rebirth and realizing : Who am I?
In easy and understandable terms, Anil Sharma has flawlessly described to aspirants who are in search of meaning of life and its earthly existence.The author explains, &quot;Our consciousness of our own being, that is &#39;I am&#39;, alone can be our real self. The non-dual and indivisible consciousness of our own being is our true consciousness, indeed it is our true self, our essential being, of what we really are.This is always present in all our three states : waking, dream and sleep, and in all the three divisions of time: past, present and future.
This is what the Sage taught one and all, the simple practice of self-attentiveness which is the path of atma-vichara, &#39;self-inquiry&#39; or self-investigation. And, whatever Sage Ramana said through his teachings, that is the only way by which we can experience perfect peace and bliss that is our own true nature, our own real being." />

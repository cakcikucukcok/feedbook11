  <title>Jesus My Son - Mary Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Greetings! Welcome to Mary&#39;s journal of Jesus&#39; early life. Can you imagine nurturing a baby, experiencing all the firsts of a toddler, teaching a young boy, tolerating a teenager, and enjoying the experiences of a young man, while always anticipating a promised kingdom? This was Mary&#39;s life. Very little is known of these early years, but Mary must have celebrated milestones just as we do today. Jesus had a first tooth, a first word, a first step, a first day of school, siblings, graduations, and other milestones like our children today. The only witness to all these events was Mary. Learn of Jesus&#39; relationship with his brothers and sisters and many cousins, including John the Baptist and Matthew. In &lt;U&gt;Jesus, My Son&lt;/U&gt;, you will watch Jesus&#39; life unfold through the eyes of his mother.&lt;/P&gt;" />

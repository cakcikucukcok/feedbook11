  <title>The Pale of Memory - Peter Halsey Sherwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, Manhattan quivered under a dreadful affliction. For one group of New Yorkers, what starts out as a caper worthy of the Hardy Boys themselves quickly spirals into a reckless mission of obsession and a dangerous love affair with dire consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crafted with the focused perspective of the voyeur, the pale of memory portrays a shifting world of the questionable protagonist, a young man named Scott. As he attempts to hide his secrets, he also tries to transform his new lover in a desperate attempt to recreate his own past. For Scott, nothing is as it seems in the swirling vortex of lies, trickery, and emotional misdirection. As perceptions are revealed and confronted, everything Scott wants to believe is challenged with haunting vigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too soon, Scotts mania reveals more than he can comprehend or manage. From the darkest memories of his curious, confusing past, Scotts present is about to spin out of control too, to a place where the pale of memory builds to a devastating crescendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchcocks Vertigo with sexy, dangerous young men. Had me hooked from page one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Busch, author of The Tale of the Allergists Wife&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently chosen as &lt;strong&gt;Book of the Month in Interior Design Magazine&lt;/strong&gt;.

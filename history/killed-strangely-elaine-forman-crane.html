  <title>Killed Strangely - Elaine Forman Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;It was Rebecca&#39;s son, Thomas, who first realized the victim&#39;s identity. His eyes were drawn to the victim&#39;s head, and aided by the flickering light of a candle, he &#39;clapt his hands and cryed out, Oh Lord, it is my mother.&#39; James Moills, a servant of Cornell . . . described Rebecca &#39;lying on the floore, with fire about Her, from her Lower parts neare to the Armepits.&#39; He recognized her only &#39;by her shoes.&#39;&quot;—from &lt;em&gt;Killed Strangely &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;P&gt;On a winter&#39;s evening in 1673, tragedy descended on the respectable Rhode Island household of Thomas Cornell. His 73-year-old mother, Rebecca, was found close to her bedroom&#39;s large fireplace, dead and badly burned. The legal owner of the Cornells&#39; hundred acres along Narragansett Bay, Rebecca shared her home with Thomas and his family, a servant, and a lodger. A coroner&#39;s panel initially declared her death &quot;an Unhappie Accident,&quot; but before summer arrived, a dark web of events—rumors of domestic abuse, allusions to witchcraft, even the testimony of Rebecca&#39;s ghost through her brother—resulted in Thomas&#39;s trial for matricide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;P&gt;Such were the ambiguities of the case that others would be tried for the murder as well. Rebecca is a direct ancestor of Cornell University&#39;s founder, Ezra Cornell. Elaine Forman Crane tells the compelling story of Rebecca&#39;s death and its aftermath, vividly depicting the world in which she lived. That world included a legal system where jurors were expected to be familiar with the defendant and case before the trial even began. Rebecca&#39;s strange death was an event of cataclysmic proportions, affecting not only her own community, but neighboring towns as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;P&gt;The documents from Thomas&#39;s trial provide a rare glimpse into seventeenth-century life. Crane writes, &quot;Instead of the harmony and respect that sermon literature, laws, and a hierarchical/patriarchal society attempted to impose, evidence illustrates filial insolence, generational conflict, disrespect toward the elderly, power plays between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, [and] adult dependence on (and resentment of) aging parents who clung to purse strings.&quot; Yet even at a distance of more than three hundred years, Rebecca Cornell&#39;s story is poignantly familiar. Her complaints of domestic abuse, Crane says, went largely unheeded by friends and neighbors until, at last, their complacency was shattered by her terrible death.&lt;/p&gt;" />

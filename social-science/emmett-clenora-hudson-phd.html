  <title>Emmett - Clenora Hudson PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So help me God, until my dying day, Im going to be fighting this thing.  Im not going to be fighting color. Im not going to be fighting creed. Im not going to be fighting anyones belief, so long as its a safe and sound one, so long as it doesnt reach out and destroy me or destroy someone else.  . . . We should stand up, we should make a stand once and for all, we should say that were going to live as men and women.
(Excerpt, Mamies 2nd speaking engagement in South Bend, IN, following the trial 	in Money, MS , OCT 1955--Hudson-Weems, Emmett Till:  Sacrificial Lamb of the Civil Rights Movement, 1994, p. 240)
The fervent prayers of Tills mother, Mamie Till Mobley, for everlasting justice and transcendent mercy have been finally answered through this gripping narrative by Dr. Clenora Hudson-Weems.  Emmett speaks eternal truth to power.
Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr.--President and CEO National Newspaper
Publishers Association (NNPA)
Truly we have witnessed it all.  We have seen the anger, felt the pain, endured the violence.  From submissiveness, to rebellion, to assimilation, at last Emmetts story and  Whittens redemption bring true heroes and iconic models for us all.
Aubrey Bruce--Senior Sports Columnist
New Pittsburgh Courier
In Emmett, Clenora gives us all that we need to advance to positive 21st. century race relations, which could greatly curtail racial domination thus, escalating to racial healing.  A cause clbre, coming on the heels of The Butler, 12 Years a Slave and Selma, Emmett no doubt is both timely and urgent!

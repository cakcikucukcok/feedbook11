  <title>Exploring the Sounds in Language - Virginia Dowling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For hundreds of years, music has been acknowledged and appreciated for its effect on our minds, emotions, and physical well-being. The generated sound waves in music have the capacity to shatter glass, soothe our minds, stir our blood, or relax us. Quite unconsciously, we use an even stronger form of sound energy every day: our voice. We tune our minds and bodies with the sounds we constantly use in our speech. These sound patterns create either a state of balance and ease or an out-of-tune condition of disease.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploring the Sounds in Language&lt;/i&gt; looks at the precision with which our speech affects the way we think, perceive and create the circumstances we encounter. This two-part narrative exploration proposes that instead of presenting a body and mind at odds with themselves, we can unite these energies and vibrations to create a centered person who gains mastery of his or her cause and purpose in life and who speaks with the unique individuality of ones whole being. The opening parable outlines the core principles of the power language wheel, while the second part suggests a society that works with the sounds and cycles of development that lead us forward, toward the attainment of our full potential.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Intriguing and unusual, this narrative exploration considers language and the effects of sound on the body and mind through the use of parable.&lt;/P&gt;" />

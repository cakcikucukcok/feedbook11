  <title>Before He Longs (A Mackenzie White Mystery—Book 10) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Blake Pierce, #1 bestselling author of ONCE GONE (a #1 bestseller with over 1,200 five star reviews), comes BEFORE HE LONGS, book #10 in the heart-pounding Mackenzie White mystery series.
BEFORE HE LONGS is book #10 in the #1 bestselling Mackenzie White mystery series, which begins with BEFORE HE KILLS (Book #1), a #1 bestseller with over 500 reviews!
FBI Special Agent Mackenzie White is summoned when another body is found dead in a self storage unit. There at first appears to be no connection between the cases; yet as Mackenzie digs deeper, she realizes it is the work of a serial killer—and that he will soon strike again.
Mackenzie will be forced to enter the mind of a madman as she tries to understand a psyche obsessed with clutter, storage, and claustrophobic places. It is a dark place from which she fears she may not return—and yet one which she must probe if she has any chance of winning the game of cat and mouse that can save new victims.
Even then, it may be too late.
A dark psychological thriller with heart-pounding suspense, BEFORE HE LONGS is book #10 in a riveting new series—with a beloved new character—that will leave you turning pages late into the night. 
Also available by Blake Pierce is ONCE GONE (A Riley Paige mystery—Book #1), a #1 bestseller with over 1,200 five star reviews—and a free download!

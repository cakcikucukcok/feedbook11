  <title>In Quest of Life - Ks Gentleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wish to see my book as a guide for those who are depressed, sad ,woe begone,Pessimist,arrogant,Egotist and stone -hearted.
The theme of my book is multiple ie&quot; Live in today&quot; Simple living high thinking&quot; &quot;Curtail attachment with materialism.Lift your soul above and be attuned with almighty.If you have surplus do not hesitate to give some to others who doesnt have. We are all created equal and we are all brothers and sisters. Live with love with each other. Love is God. Hate is of the Devil.
Think yourself as a traveler in this world.Life is a short journey. Soon it will end and anon you have to go towards unknown there and then without dilly dally. Dont live like a slave being caught in by mundane illusionment and fugacious enchantment. Live always free of all bondages ties,taboos and tinsel snares whatsoever.
Life is nothing but unending episode of unavoidable vicissitudes.From the very beginning to the end it has been followed by sorrows and happiness on slaughts.but in fact the outcome of life is mystic absolutely confusion casting.
During life when we face adversity we cry helplessly like a timid and innocent child; but during prosperity we laugh and behave wildly and stupidity and become arrogant and egotist.
Whichever angle you live or look at life ,life looks as if the same. But we should live or look at life mostly in terms of soul not body. I believe  if we think life in terms of soul; lot of lifes foreseen and unforeseen problems be automatically mitigated and vanished. And life will become easy to live .Life become stressless,worryless ,fearless and troubleless." />

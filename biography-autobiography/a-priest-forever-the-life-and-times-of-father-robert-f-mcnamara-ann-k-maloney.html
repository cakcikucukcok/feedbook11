  <title>A Priest Forever: The Life and Times of Father Robert F. Mcnamara - Ann K. Maloney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Priest Forever: The Life and Times of Father Robert McNamara draws together research, insights from family, parishioners, and colleagues, and original writings to fashion a portrait of Father Robert Francis McNamara, a Roman Catholic priest who served the church&#39;s Rochester Diocese. Ann K. Maloney draws together material from a variety of sources to present the life and times of a man whom Rochester&#39;s Bishop Matthew H. Clark called &quot;an extraordinary man.&quot;   In a time in the church&#39;s history when deep doubts about the clergy lead many to question the trustworthiness of the church itself, A Priest Forever tells how one man-a faithful servant of God-carried out both his calling to priestly service and his immersion in the life of his wider community. Five chapters present Father Bob, as he was known, and tell the story of his life. A rich set of appendices collects a sampling of his writings, his curriculum vitae, and supporting documentation." />

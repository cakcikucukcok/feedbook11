  <title>An Creanaiche - Roddy MacLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people won&#39;t believe this story. That&#39;s the way it is, and I understand that. The first time I met M?iri NicEachairne, I didn&#39;t believe it either. But her story is so astonishing and so important for the whole world that I couldn&#39;t ignore it. Little by little, I was drawn in by what M?iri had to say. I came to understand that her account of what happened when JFK was murdered in Dealey Plaza was true. M?iri knew Lee Oswald (she never called him &#39;Harvey&#39;) in Dallas in the autumn of 1963. She knew things about the murder of President Kennedy that no-one else knew, at least outside of the gang that was involved in the murder. For that reason, she had to flee the United States. She was in fear of her life. Perhaps she still is. But now she has cancer and hasn&#39;t much longer to live." />

  <title>Spice Up - Rachel A. Frias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spice Up
The topics covered in this second volume of Short Bedtime Stories titled Spice Up are illustrated by themes such as:
Ignoring a hurting body, being in fashion, super human machines, parent love, perfect synchronization of music and crime schedules, martial arts surprise, consumer trust at restaurants, weapons in the civilian world, power of an Alcoholic Anonymous agent, family trees, the paranoia of reputable scientists, Fermis Paradox, automobile insurance abuses, testing of care products on animals, where anti-Semitism has one of many roots, in addition some other themes in Spice Up by Rachel A. Frias are an obsession with obesity, not fitting in as a tourist, schools administrations despair to meet standards, chat misunderstandings, desperate for tax money and also, missing part of childhood.
Stories in Spice Up may be summarized into categories ranging through any of these:
Male vanity, stress at work, parents love, automotive crime, sports, hostelry, robbery, AA, progeny, scientific curiosities, anti-Semitism, foreign obesity, administration plans, taxes to students home life.
Provide Proof:
By including a bit of actuality and surrounding these bare bone issues with a plush environment, the author of Spice Up, Rachel A. Frias, brings fiction to life through story and conversation.  Each of the 21 stories in Spice Up is unique and contains at least one element of surprise as one reads the daring writers composition take for instance the short story titled, Noahs Cell- where the interpretation of Noahs old wooden boat tale, is taken to the extravagant clarification of being a human cell, which carries the genetic code to form all animals on Earth, if the process of development is stopped at different times.  Fermis Paradox relays the unattainable space odyssey that of leaving Earth to survive in a different part of the Universe.
Be original:
To illustrate further the novelty of these 21 short stories in Spice Up by Rachel A. Frias, check that such a modern topic as Tax fraud by Mr. Merredith a retired teacher and tax advisor- takes advantage of Bernie, who innocently, spreads the word on how to become fraudulent.
Counter Objections:
Spice Up is a work of fiction not meant for children because some topics are censored to minors.  These short stories address situations that can occur in a community and are a mild recall in awareness that what could happen can be prevented and avoided as what could happen in The Jews where a personality exchange scares Grace away from Jewish men, forcing her to hate them.
2.  What inspired you to write these books?
Inspired by dream, fantasy, and common or mysterious situations developed into fiction, created these collections of short stories.
Controversial topics are presented, inviting the readers possible curtailed stimulation to be uplifted, and provoke thoughts otherwise committed to the discretion of others. 
3.  Where do these books take place?
Mainly NY, the USA and Europe.  I thought of writing a short story on Eskimos.
4.  Who are the main characters, what are their relationships, and why are they important to the story?
The characters are diverse, well defined, random types who are victims or aggressors making important decisions on current, controversial issues, based on their life styles and upbringing.
5.  Why do you think that these books will appeal to the readers? 
I offered a dare and wrote Straight Up including stories to offer the public entertainment, a few thoughts to be discussed such as stem cell research, abortion, queers, self-sacrifice, just to mention a few. I suggested some provocation in my second book Spice Up with thoughts to be discussed such as AA, health, perfectionism and automotive insurance abuse, just to mention a few.   As the author to Straight Up and Spice Up I hope reading these short story collections, make these worthwhile books through inspiration, and future, well thought-out decision making on the readers part.
6.  Target Audience:
Scientists, technicians, engineers, college students, teachers and any bibliophile who likes cognitive picking.
1.	Who are the characters in your books stories? Can you provide any specific examples?
In Straight Up Ambrosio is a mechanic with a dark side to his life. Helena is an office worker who faces the deterioration of her body while others profit from it. Bernie is a Town Clerk who is ripped-off while filing taxes.  Nathaniel is an obstinate technician who gets himself into an odd situation.  Professor Taylore takes advantage of Julia, while he is under the influence of self-made and self-administered medication.  Mary Crevitch is witness to the playback of a live animal and a plant as well as some of her own actions. There are many other characters.
In Spice Up  Herman, recently retired, finds out most of his physical problems originate from a bad back.  Fiona and Silvan experience a trip into a culinary nightmare to ascertain the cleanliness of a restaurant.  Sabina plays Little Red Riding Hood while the Big Bad Wolf loves her conversations. Catalina, The Seors maid, finds out how paranoid her benefactor is when she cleans the house.  Doctor Marga Azack abuses automobile insurance to her benefit, through lies and vandalism.  There are many other characters.
2.	Is this your first book? If not, please list other books that you have written 
These are my first two books, Straight Up and Spice Up
Who is Rachel A. Frias?
The author of Straight Up and Spice Up is offering no advice, doesnt sell a potion or magic lotion, however would like to offer entertainment.  A discussion is an investment into better living and these short stories reflect an awareness of human behavior, that Rachel A. Frias, having been a teacher, can write about to enjoy in a fictitious presentation in each of these short stories.
I was brought up in Spain, Europe.  At an early age, my American mother, Sarah an English teacher, would pull me away from the childrens playground to read and do written exercises in English from an American childs magazine Highlights to which we subscribed at the time.  You can imagine the pain I felt having to leave the playground sweaty and red from playing- to just read and do the English homework, which other Spanish children did not have.  
At the age of fourteen, I attended Oakwood School, in NY. There I attended a Black English teachers class, whom I thought the world of because his English was so prim, and proper.
At Clarkson University, one English professor allotted me an A for a short story, in which, the philosophical discussion of property and destruction I made, was within a western setting.  After working for many years, I suffered a back injury which prevented my normal activities.  I laid down most of the time writing these short stories keeping in mind basic human psychology and philosophy from a technical perspective -being an engineer and scientist." />

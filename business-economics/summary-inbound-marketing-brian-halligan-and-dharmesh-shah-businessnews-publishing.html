  <title>Summary: Inbound marketing - Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;INBOUND MARKETING: Get Found Using Google, Social Media, and Blogs&quot; by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah.Customers today are getting far better at ignoring outbound marketing aimed at them. They have spam folders, recording devices to fast-forward through adverts and caller ID on their phones. Halligan and Shah demonstrate that far better results can be achieved by inbound marketing, where your customers find you, or you are recommended to customers by a trusted source. Therefore, social media, blogs and search engines have become all-powerful tools. The great news for companies, the authors explain, is that this doesn’t require the vast investment of the ad campaigns of the past. You need to establish your message with care, but getting it out there needn’t be extortionate. Halligan and Shah explain how to convert people from visitors, to prospects, leads, opportunities then customers through specific messages at specific times. Inbound marketing is also a way of analyzing your customers. By using social media such as Twitter, you can ask people directly how they would improve your product.In short, inbound marketing can be cheaper, more effective, and help you create a better product without costly market research. Inbound Marketing is a must-read for every savvy businessperson." />

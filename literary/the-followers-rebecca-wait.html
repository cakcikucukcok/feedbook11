  <title>The Followers - Rebecca Wait</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Followers&lt;/i&gt; is a compassionate and suspenseful story of the dissolution of a family. Judith has been visiting her mother, Stephanie, in prison once a month for the last eight years. She still can&#39;t bring herself to talk with her mother about what brought them here--or about Nathaniel, the man whose religious cult almost cost them their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Stephanie first meets him, she is a struggling single mother and&lt;br&gt; Nathaniel is a charismatic outsider, unlike anyone she&#39;s ever known. In deciding to join the small religious cult he has founded, Stephanie thinks she is doing the best thing for her daughter: a new home, a new purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Judith and Stephanie are initiated into a secret society whose &quot;followers&quot; must obey the will of a zealous prophet. As Stephanie immerses herself in her new life, Judith slowly realizes the moral implications of the strict lifestyle Nathaniel preaches. Tensions deepen, faith and doubt collide, and a horrifying act of violence changes everything. In the shattering aftermath, it seems that no one is safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Powerful, gripping, and impossible to forget, &lt;i&gt;The Followers&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about&lt;br&gt; love, hope, and identity that asks timely questions: Are we still responsible for our actions if we remake ourselves in someone else&#39;s image? And can there be a way back?" />

  <title>The Home That Was Our Country - Alia Malek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alia Malek weaves a lyrical narrative around the history of her family&#39;s apartment building in the heart of Damascus, the many lives that crossed in the stairwell, and how the fates of her neighbors reflect the fate of her country.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the Arab Spring&#39;s hopeful start, Alia Malek returned to Damascus to reclaim her grandmother&#39;s apartment, which had been lost to her family since Hafez al-Assad came to power in 1970. Its loss was central to her parent&#39;s decision to make their lives in America. In chronicling the people who lived in the Tahaan building, past and present, Alia portrays the Syrians--the Muslims, Christians, Jews, Armenians, and Kurds--who worked, loved, and suffered in close quarters, mirroring the political shifts in their country. Restoring her family&#39;s home as the country comes apart, she learns how to speak the coded language of oppression that exists in a dictatorship, while privately confronting her own fears about Syria&#39;s future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Home That Was Our Country &lt;/i&gt;is a deeply researched, personal journey that shines a delicate but piercing light on Syrian history, society, and politics. Teeming with insights, the narrative weaves acute political analysis with a century of intimate family history, delivering an unforgettable portrait of the Syria that is being erased.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

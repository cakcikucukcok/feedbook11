  <title>Mongrels - Stephen Graham Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominated for both the Shirley Jackson and Bram Stoker Awards, and a Best of 2016 selection of Tor.com and Book Riot, acclaimed horror writer Stephen Graham Jones&#39; &lt;em&gt;Mongrels &lt;/em&gt;goes beyond your typical werewolf story to show a young boy, mired in poverty and always on the run, coming-of-age in a world that fears him and hates his family...but may just be more monstrous than he could ever be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born an outsider, like the rest of his family. Poor yet resilient, he lives in the shadows with his aunt Libby and uncle Darren, folk who stubbornly make their way in a society that does not understand or want them. They are mongrels, mixed blood, neither this nor that. The boy at the center of &lt;em&gt;Mongrels&lt;/em&gt; must decide if he belongs on the road with his aunt and uncle, or if he fits with the people on the other side of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten years, he and his family have lived a life of late-night exits and narrow escapes&amp;#8212;always on the move across the South to stay one step ahead of the law. But the time is drawing near when Darren and Libby will finally know if their nephew is like them or not. And the close calls they&amp;#8217;ve been running from for so long are catching up fast now. Everything is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compelling and fascinating journey, &lt;em&gt;Mongrels&lt;/em&gt; alternates between past and present to create an unforgettable portrait of a boy trying to understand his family and his place in a complex and unforgiving world. A smart and innovative story&amp;#8212; funny, bloody, raw, and real&amp;#8212;told in a rhythmic voice full of heart, &lt;em&gt;Mongrels&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply moving, sometimes grisly, novel that illuminates the challenges and tender joys of a life beyond the ordinary in a bold and imaginative new way.&lt;/p&gt;" />

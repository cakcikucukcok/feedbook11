  <title>The Rise of the Tudors - Chris Skidmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the morning of August 22, 1485, in fields several miles from Bosworth, two armies faced each other, ready for battle. The might of Richard III&#39;s army was pitted against the inferior forces of the upstart pretender to the crown, Henry Tudor, a twenty-eight year old Welshman who had just arrived back on British soil after fourteen years in exile. Yet this was to be a fight to the death--only one man could survive; only one could claim the throne. It would be the end of the War of the Roses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would become one of the most legendary battles in English history: the only successful invasion since Hastings, it was the last time a king died on the battlefield. But The Rise Of The Tudors is much more than the account of the dramatic events of that fateful day in August. It is a tale of brutal feuds and deadly civil wars, and the remarkable rise of the Tudor family from obscure Welsh gentry to the throne of England--a story that began sixty years earlier with Owen Tudor&#39;s affair with Henry V&#39;s widow, Katherine of Valois.&lt;br&gt;Drawing on eyewitness reports, newly discovered manuscripts and the latest archaeological evidence, including the recent discovery of Richard III&#39;s remains, Chris Skidmore vividly recreates this battle-scarred world and the reshaping of British history and the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;" />

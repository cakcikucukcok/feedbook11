  <title>Supporting Families of Children With Developmental Disabilities: Evidence-based and Emerging Practices - Mian Wang, George H. S. Singer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Supporting Families of Children with Developmental Disabilities: Evidence-based and Emerging Practices provides a comprehensive review of the empirical evidence on interventions for families of individuals - ranging from post-preschool age to adulthood - with developmental disabilities. The book presents both narrative and meta-analytic syntheses of a large body of research to evaluate which interventions meet contemporary standards as evidence based practices. The body of studies reviewed in the book has not previously been gathered into one volume, nor evaluated as a whole for the quality and extent of the evidence. The research is presented in the context of contemporary social policy and practices aimed at maximizing the development of children with disabilities while increasing the quality of life of their families. The criteria and procedures followed for identifying, reviewing, evaluating, and categorizing the studies are articulated in line with other major professional standards. Individual chapters focus on several different schools of practice, including: group psycho-educational interventions, behavioral parent training, multiple component interventions, supportive interventions for families of children with autism, home- and school-based practices, self-help groups, and advocacy programs. Supporting Families of Children with Developmental Disabilities is an important tool for moving the disability field forward for future research, practice, and social policy." />

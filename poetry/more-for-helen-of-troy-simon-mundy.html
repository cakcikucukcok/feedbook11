  <title>More for Helen of Troy - Simon Mundy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More for Helen of Troy, Simon Mundy&#39;s new collection of poems from Seren, is suffused with the atmosphere of the landscapes that inspire him, the lush countryside of Powys, and a number of islands all over the world:Genada, Jamaica, Shetland, Italy. It is also deeply involved with many questions of desire: for the ideal of a beautiful woman, as &#39;Mermaid&#39;; for the hope of a good state, as in &#39;The New Senedd, Cardiff&#39; for the vision of a pristine country and seaside, as in &#39;Radnor Songs&#39; and &#39;Aspects of Sea&#39;. The tension between all these ideals, between lofty aims and inevitable disappointments, come together in the main title sequence, where an entire society must scheme and suffer for the allure of Helen. Helen is also emblematic: both a legendary figure and a imago for women from all times: pursued, desired, lonely, restless, she haunts the imagination of the poet. Sometimes keenly satirical, as in &#39;Society Haiku&#39;, and often poignantly lyrical as in &#39;Translated Daughter&#39;, these poems are both pointed and enjoyable." />

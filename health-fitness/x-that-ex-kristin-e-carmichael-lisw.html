  <title>X That Ex - Kristin E. Carmichael, Lisw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Hell no. It&amp;#8217;s over. I am done.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saying it to him felt so damned good. God knows he deserved it. Still deserves it. So why is it that only a few weeks later, I doubt if I can stand by what I said? &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;X That Ex&lt;/I&gt; is the long-awaited answer for women who have left a bad relationship and don&amp;#8217;t want to go back. It is incredibly common for women to leave partners who are emotionally unavailable, disrespectful, immature, selfish or even abusive, but then struggle to stay away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Women might be tripped up by their exes&amp;#8217; schemes to get them back, their own self-sabotaging ways or even by our society, which seems to glorify a &quot;just give him one more chance&quot; philosophy. To their family and friends&amp;#8217; dismay, huge numbers of women go back to toxic relationships, wasting years and the possibility of happier lives on men who can&amp;#8217;t give them what they deserve.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the post-breakup world for most people were logical, fair, regulated and well-defined, there would be no need for &lt;I&gt;X That Ex&lt;/I&gt;. As most of us know, however, the time after a breakup is emotionally messy, sometimes chaotic and filled with conflicting feelings, motivations, hopes, temptations and realities that must be dealt with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;X That Ex&lt;/I&gt; focuses on this confusing time, demystifying why it is so difficult to stay away from a problematic ex, and distinguishing itself by making personalized predictions for readers about what to expect from their exes and themselves in the tumultuous time right after a relationship ends. This book is a unique roadmap that guides readers through the sometimes perilous time when a woman&amp;#8217;s ex might try time-tested tactics to tempt her back, when self-sabotage may make a woman her own worst enemy, and when even our culture gets in on the action by making reunification seem reasonable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

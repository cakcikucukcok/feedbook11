  <title>Whispers in the Breath - Austin Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of every person who has lived, who is living now, or will ever live? Knowing the answer to this question will make sense of our daily living. How can I live as one with God? By knowing the answer, we can fulfill our destiny. We can live in joy and peace and make sense of the path of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we live without judgment of ourselves and all others? We will be truly free to make a difference in the lives of others when we are totally accepting of others. By doing this we can separate their actions from their being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the process that brings us to this place in life? I have found that the concept of the sweet hour of prayer will do this for us. This book will describe the process. I will offer a free, webcast daily seminar to help you along the way. I have used this process for many years and it will take us home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is the first of three. The second and third books will use mostly text and a few poems to help guide you on your way. I have found that asking questions and making honest observations have helped me develop an attitude that makes daily living easier and will disclose the beauty of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whispers in the Breath is available in eBook format on amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;" />

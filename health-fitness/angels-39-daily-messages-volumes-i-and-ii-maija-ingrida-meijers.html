      <meta name="description" content="For anyone, from any faith, here is a book of daily inspirational letters, from some loving Angels, that can help in everyday life.  Whether the reader is looking for inspiration for daily contemplation, or exercises for a personal spiritual quest, or just for a possible answer to a question, &quot;Angels Daily Message&quot; can be helpful.  The letters hold timeless thoughts and simple routines that can assist the reader in finding personal joy, inner growth, and comfort.&lt;P&gt;
	Written in a format that encourages each reader to feel personally addressed, the messages deal with universal issues of forgiveness, love, humor, honor, and compassion.  Transmitted, during mystic prayer, to the writer, for publication on the world wide web, the letters are meant to be used as a daily springboard for meditation.  They may also be used as a quick focus when the user is trying to choose how to respond to a certain situation or challenge.
   Users report that they find the messages &quot;very uplifting&quot; and &quot;a warm way to start the day&quot;.  &lt;P&gt;
	The messages emphasize a positive approach to finding ones own best path, and to seeking compassionate, soul-directed solutions to lifes problems.  A total of eight volumes of Daily Messages are planned.  The Angels preface each letter with this thought:&lt;P&gt;
	These angelic messages are transmitted with the loving intention that each person who sees them might be inspired or comforted by them that day.  If you are seeing this, please consider it a personal message to you.  We hope we are of assistance.  All Blessings to you. &lt;P&gt;        With love, Spirit
&lt;P&gt;

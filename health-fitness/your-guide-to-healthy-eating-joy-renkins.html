For most people, it&#39;s getting more exercise and eating a healthier diet.  But, how do you know if you are eating healthy or not?  There are so many different diets and strategies on the market, how do you know what to do?  This eBook is designed to provide you with some basic guidelines to become a healthy eater as well as some tips on how to begin changing your eating habits.  For example, breakfast is incredibly important and many people don&#39;t give it its due.  You need to eat breakfast to literally &quot;break the fast.&quot;  Unfortunately, many people skip breakfast and they are so hungry by the time lunch comes around that they eat like they&#39;ve never eaten before.  Then they have a slump and want to take a nap.  Eating healthy and with good eating habits can solve these types of problems." />

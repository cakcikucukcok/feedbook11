  <title>Amazing Grace, John 1:17 - Grace Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a true story about the salvation found through accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, the glory of God, and learning the meaning of the Holy Word of God.  It is about how I was saved by the Grace of God through His revelation and that the path to eternal salvation is through Jesus.  God does not look at our imperfections, but through the perfection of what Jesus has done on Calvary in love, faith, and hope.  This message is to all who are struggling with the events of their lives.  We all face unpleasant events in our lives from financial problems, marital issues, and children gone astray, and so on.  Jesus teaches us our battles are not flesh and blood but are spiritual.  Through prayer, hope, and accepting Jesus into our lives, each one of us will experience our own victories.  The divine love God has for us will lead us and guide our hearts and souls into the arms of Jesus Christ.  Satan will attempt to confuse us.  He will try to divide and conquer us.  By accepting Jesus Christ, you will always have an ally in the battle, and in the end, Satan will lose.  I pray through my faith in Jesus Christ that you will find the answers to all your struggles.  I hope and pray that by sharing my personal experiences, the struggles, and battles that I have faced and I am facing to this day, that it will give comfort to know that there is no depth, no height, and no darkness that can keep you from the destiny of Gods call in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

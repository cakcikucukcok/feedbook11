  <title>Faa.....It Is About Safety - George Romich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book more than anything else is a history in short of two transportation systems. About America in the past 150 years. How one was built by private money (the Robber Barons) who produced a national infrastructure that has lasted to this day. About how these people through their generosity made hospitals, Schools, Libraries. The other is the one made by the Government. Interstates, Airports. This system has been around since the mid sixties. Today is falling apart due to lack of government funding. This book shows how local Politics controls where the money is going and how.

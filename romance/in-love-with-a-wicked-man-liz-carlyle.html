  <title>In Love With a Wicked Man - Liz Carlyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Liz Carlyle has created a breathtaking new romance about a man without scruples and the lady who brings him to his knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it matter if Kate, Lady d&amp;#39;Allenay, has absolutely no marriage prospects? She has a castle to tend, an estate to run, and a sister to watch over, which means she is never, ever reckless. Until an accident brings a handsome, virile stranger to Bellecombe Castle, and Kate finds herself tempted to surrender to her houseguest&amp;#39;s wicked kisses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disowned by his aristocratic family, Lord Edward Quartermaine has turned his gifted mind to ruthless survival. Feared and vilified as proprietor of London&amp;#39;s most notorious gaming salon, he now struggles to regain his memory, certain of only one thing: he wants all Kate is offering&amp;#8212;and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Edward&amp;#39;s memory returns, he and Kate realize how much they have wagered on a scandalous passion that could be her ruin, but perhaps his salvation.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Naked - Leslie Masters Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In, Naked. This is My StoryThis is Our Song, Dr. Masters has, with finesse and conviction, written a basic primer on personal storytelling. With her own mesmerizing story woven throughout, Dr. Masters successfully connects the real with the surreal. Naked is a story within a lesson and a lesson within a story. More than that Naked is lifelife bubbling over with success, tragedy, pain, renewal, failure, transformation, and redemption. It is a guttural look at what it means to be a human beingboth contemptible and beyond contempt. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Naked is the true story of Leslie Masters, a 45 year old physician, single mother of three, soccer mom, cheer and gymnastics coach, cosmetic medicine expert, entrepreneur, small business owner, imperfect, spiritual human being. As she tells her story in the first person singular, Dr. Masters lures the reader onto the mindboggling and at times bewitching trail of recovery and discovery. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From DEA officers in her office to mice in her kitchen, Dr. Masters&#39; artistry in storytelling will make you laugh, make you cry and introduce you to emotions you have not known before. With the benevolence and compassion of a trusted friend she holds out her hand and both invites and emboldens the reader to tell the one story that only they can telltheir own story. Dr. Masters reaches deep within the wisdom of the ages and from Plato to Jesus, Buddha to Einstein and Sigmund Freud to Bill Wilson, Dr. Masters helps us transform teachings into right here, right now applications. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What makes this book special is that it is wretched, raucous, raw and real. Dr. Masters shows with brutal honesty, courage and sophistication just what telling your story is all about. Leslie is bright, articulate, and funnyand what she becomes to the reader is a treasured intimate friend. Before the final page has been turned, Dr. Masters has become Lesliea flawed, broken, faulty, incomplete member of humanity. The result is a captivating work that is relevant, and even necessary, in the world that we all live in today. Fueled by the power of truth, this is a story that needs to be heard.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

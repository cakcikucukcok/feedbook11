  <title>THE JAPANESE FAIRY WORLD - 35 illustrated stories from the Wonderlore of Japan - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by W E Griffis, Illustrated by Ozawa of Tokio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 35 Japanese Children&amp;rsquo;s Fairy Stories &amp;nbsp;taken from the Wonderlore of Japan &amp;ndash; and plentiful it is. Japanese lore was well already established when Europe was starting to emerge from the Dark Ages. Compiled in the 19th C. by W E Griffis these stories have been illustrated by Ozawa of Tokio which bring a further dimension to the tales.&lt;br /&gt;
You will fascinating find stories like The Meeting of the Star Lovers, The Travels of Two Frogs, The Child of the Thunder, The Fire-fly&amp;#39;s Lovers, The Battle of the Ape and the Crab, The Wonderful Tea-Kettle and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The thirty-five stories included within this volume do not contain the usual bloody, and sometimes licentious, elements, with which Japanese popular, and juvenile literature seems to be saturated. These have been avoided to create a volume of children&amp;rsquo;s stories containing folklore, fairy tales, myths, legends suitable for a western audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So sit back with steaming beverage and prepare to be entertained for hours.&lt;br /&gt;
=====================&lt;br /&gt;
BIO&lt;br /&gt;
William Elliot Griffis (September 17, 1843 &amp;ndash; February 5, 1928) was an American orientalist, Congregational minister, lecturer, and prolific author.&lt;br /&gt;
During the American Civil War he served as corporal. After the war, he attended Rutgers University at New Brunswick, New Jersey, graduating in 1869. At Rutgers, Griffis was an English and Latin language tutor for Tar? Kusakabe, a young samurai from the province of Echizen, now part of the Fukui prefecture.&lt;br /&gt;
In September 1870 Griffis was invited to Japan by Matsudaira Shungaku, for the purpose of organizing schools along modern lines. In 1871, he was Superintendent of Education in the province of Echizen. In recompense, he was provided with a salary, a house and a horse in Fukui.&lt;br /&gt;
Griffis was a founding member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters (later to become the American Academy of Arts and Letters), the American Historical Association, and the U.S. Naval Institute. He died at his winter home in Florida in 1928.&lt;br /&gt;
One of Griffis&amp;#39; two sons, Stanton Griffis, became U.S. Ambassador to Poland, Egypt, Spain and Argentina under President Truman. He was ambassador to Argentina while Juan and Eva Peron were in power and wrote of his experiences in a book titled Lying In State. The son, John, became a composer.&lt;br /&gt;

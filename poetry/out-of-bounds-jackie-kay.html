  <title>Out of Bounds - Jackie Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From Aberdeen to the Isle of Wight, Out of Bounds is a newly charted map of Britain as viewed by its black and Asian poets. It takes the reader on a riveting, sensory journey through Scotland, England and Wales, showing the whole country from a fresh perspective. This extensive and ground-breaking anthology &amp;amp;#150; with its sudden forks in the road, and its roads not taken &amp;amp;#150; stops off in the Highlands and Islands, skirts the North East coast from Whitley Bay to the sands of Bridlington, wanders lonely through the Lake District and Yorkshire, climbs the mountains of Wales before descending to the Black Country and Southern England. Along the way it takes in lochs and landmarks from Glasgow&amp;amp;#8217;s George Square and the Angel of the North to the London Eye and the Long Man of Wilmington. An alternative A to Z of the nation, a new poetic guide, the book enables us to look again at the UK&amp;amp;#8217;s local and regional landscapes and the poets who pass through them. Out of Bounds is a definitive anthology that brings together new and established black and Asian writers and places them firmly on the map of what is great and not so great about Britain. &amp;amp;#145;This book really redraws the map of Britain: away with taxonomies of hurt &amp;amp;#150; welcome cartographies of worth&amp;amp;#8217; &amp;amp;#150; Fred D&amp;amp;#8217;Aguiar &#39;This is a stunning anthology, every page yielding thought-provoking poetry that is immediate and direct...this superb, relevant, topical, crucial, important anthology should be in every secondary school and sixth-form library.&#39; - Frank Startup, The School Librarian Includes: Shanta Acharya, John Agard, Patience Agbabi, Moniza Alvi, James Berry, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean &#39;Binta&#39; Breeze, Vahni Capildeo, Kayo Chingonyi, Maya Chowdhry, Merle Collins, David Dabydeen, Fred D&#39;Aguiar, Kwame Dawes, Imtiaz Dharker, Bernardine Evaristo, Lorna Goodison, Maggie Harris, Khadijah Ibrahiim, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Anthony Joseph, Jackie Kay, Tariq Latif, Sheree Mack, Jack Mapanje, E.A.

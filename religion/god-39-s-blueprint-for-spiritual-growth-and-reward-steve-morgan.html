  <title>God&#39;s Blueprint for Spiritual Growth and Reward - Steve Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When God set out to ensure that man could continue to commune with him after the fall of Adam and Eve, he operated by specific principles that where set in order before the beginning of time.  Two such principles are the Law of Sin and Death and the Law of Life in the Blood.  God, who understands our need for a consistency, operated within these and many other principles to keep our communications open.  
The journey the Israelites took from Egypt to Canaans Land was significant in that it revealed many wonderful truths about the progressive growth in walking with Jesus Christ.   Likewise, the journey the High Priest made once a year into the Holy of Holies is a significant teacher on our walk with Christ today. 
In this book you will find some profound similarities with our walk as Christians in this era as we strive to grow up in Him unto the Measure and Stature of Jesus Christ.  You will have found where you are in your journey to full maturity and understand what the next steps are for you to continue.  Jesus is still the same yesterday, today and forever!" />

  <title>Overcoming the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African American Young Women - Freeman A. Hrabowski, Kenneth I. Maton, Monica L. Greene, Geoffrey L. Greif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Beating the Odds: Raising Academically Successful African American Males appeared in 1998, it was hailed as a crucial book (Baltimore Sun) and undoubtedly one of the most important tools the African American parent can possess (Kweisi Mfume, President NAACP).      Now, in response to enormous demand, the authors turn their attention to African American young women. Statistics indicate that African American females, as a group, fare poorly in the United States. Many live in single-parent households-either as the single-parent mother or as the daughter. Many face severe economic hurdles. Yet despite these obstacles, some are performing at exceptional levels academically. Based on interviews with many of these successful young women and their families, Overcoming the Odds provides a wealth of information about how and why they have succeeded--what motivates them, how their backgrounds and family relationships have shaped them, even how it feels to be a high academic achiever. They also discuss the challenges of moving into African American womanhood, from maintaining self-esteem to making the right choices about their professional and personal lives. Most important, the book offers specific and inspiring examples of the practices, attitudes, and parenting strategies that have enabled these women to persevere and triumph.         For parents, educators, policy makers, and indeed all those concerned about the education of young African American women, Overcoming the Odds is an invaluable guidebook on creating the conditions that lead to academic-and lifelong-success." />

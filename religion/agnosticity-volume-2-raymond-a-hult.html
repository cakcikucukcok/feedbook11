  <title>Agnosticity Volume 2 - Raymond A. Hult</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Agnosticity&lt;/i&gt; is a new word created by the author with the hope that it will cause the reader to take a fresh look at how Agnostics think.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trafford.com/06-0786&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Volume 1&lt;/a&gt; reflected Agnostic concerns surrounding Christian doctrine in general and was the first of a series intended to analyze the belief systems of major organized religions around the world.  &lt;b&gt;Volume 2&lt;/b&gt; concentrates on the Agnostic concerns of Mormon doctrine as an example of a religion established by a charismatic leader claiming a present day visit by God.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Utilizing the experience gained from his twenty-seven years as a Special Agent for the FBI, the author employs deductive reasoning and dogged research to justify the Agnostic point of view. This book is written so that the average person can easily understand the doubts that Agnostics struggle with in trying  to decide the existence of God from the Mormon perspective. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
An active adult member of the Mormon faith for over twenty-seven years, the author has attempted to separate the wheat from the chaff in identifying those specific doctrines that are most bothersome for honest Mormons to confront.  The author&#39;s primary goal remains to portray the Agnostic in a more favorable light and that there is nothing inherently evil with admitting that a sure knowledge of God may not be so sure after all.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Rabbi Akiva, Bar Kokhba Revolt, and the Ten Tribes of Israel - Alexander Zephyr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alexander Zephyr is the author of The State of Israel: Its Friends and Enemies. Prophetic Future. Like his previous work, Rabbi Akiva, the Bar Kokhba Revolt and the Ten Tribes of Israel focuses on the fate and destiny of the so-called Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. It is a fascinating and climactic story told with passion, conviction, and extensive knowledge of Scripture, the Talmud, and Rabbinical literature.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the Ten Tribes is a key theme of the book, the main hero is Rabbi Akivahis life, his students, and particularly his association with Bar Kokhba and the Jewish Revolt of 132-135CE. One of the few rare scholars with the courage to present the authentic story of R. Akiva, Zephyr covers the legendary figures involvement in the Jewish-Roman war as well as his dramatic and mistaken announcement of Bar Kokhba as the God-chosen Messiah. This book is the story of a massacre of the Jewish people in an unparalleled historical tragedy, the consequences of which are still suffered today. It is also a testament of life-affirming faith in the Scriptural promise of a Messianic Era and the World-to-Come.&lt;/p&gt;" />

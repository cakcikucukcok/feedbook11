The only time their walls came down was during one night of passion before Ana left without a word, never expecting to cross paths with Blake again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later, Blake has made his millions.

And Ana can&#39;t fall for the man who could become her boss--it&#39;s not only her job at stake, but her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Hope Springs series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Tangling with the CEO&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Brushing off the Boss&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Guarding His Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Creating Something  from Nothing - Kenneth F. George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Losing was a luxury I could not afford. I was a team of one, creating
something from nothing utilizing my own technique called the Reverse. The
Reverse is a series of interlocking concepts both in and around the fi eld of
sales. This technique will show you how to never lose, overcome naysayers,
and take control which is the key to the close.
I involve the reader, critic, and salesperson in my narrative. This book is
different than your typical sales training manual, and possibly a bit off the
wall with its vanity, fl ashbacks, controversy, subtle humor, and instructions.
I still host seminars and individual consultations about how to create
something from nothing  call 586-873-2987
And stop looking for pictures  this isnt a comic book!
Kenneth F. George is a National Sales Champion. He is
an expert on the strategies of persuasive selling. He wrote
the satirical book The Sales Trap and recorded the tape
Personal Commitment. Ken developed job fair programs
during the 1980s recession. He is represented in Whos
Who of the Midwest." />

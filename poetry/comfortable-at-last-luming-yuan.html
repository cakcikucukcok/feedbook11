  <title>Comfortable at Last - Luming Yuan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A paintbrush in the hallway and the smell of fresh blank sheets of paper reassured a fourteen-year-old girl on her first day of middle school, the art school she decided to take a long journey to go to, a place far away from her safe haven of family and friends. Lumings life was full of transitions like those, and it nurtured her sense of creativity. Her passion for writing and art, her love for poems, have led her to become who she is today. She enshrined her cherished dreams, whirlwind of fears, bliss of beauty, memory of first love, joys and pains of growing up in this poetry collection." />

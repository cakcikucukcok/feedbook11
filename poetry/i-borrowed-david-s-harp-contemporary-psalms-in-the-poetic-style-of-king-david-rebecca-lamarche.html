  <title>I  Borrowed  David’S  Harp—Contemporary Psalms in the Poetic Style of King David - Rebecca Lamarche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brilliant panache is added to the genre of introspection and self-growth! Rebecca has artistically resurrected the beautiful, poetic worship style of the Shepherd-King David. A unique, fresh approach brings new inspiration to your journaling. With imaginative skill, she utilizes the written word like a paintbrush in her picturesque turn of phrase by shading meaning into the ordinary. This stimulating fashion will add a splash of refreshment to your quiet time!&lt;br&gt;
Contemporary, Psalm-style poetry opens each topical thought, prayer or praise, accompanied by &lt;br&gt;
 an interesting,&lt;br&gt;
 often entertaining,&lt;br&gt;
 always stimulating&lt;br&gt;
 short narrative of the topic that sketches a present-day life application.&lt;br&gt;
Scriptures re-enforce the power tool of Gods Word, and blank lined pages are included to allow for the poet in you to compose your own thoughts and psalms!&lt;br&gt;
Destined to reignite the expressive spirit of worship to personal devotion and journaling!&lt;br&gt;
Makes a delightful gift book!&lt;br&gt;
Dont forget to give one to yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endorsement&lt;br&gt;
At once inspirational and vulnerable, Rebecca Lamarches I Borrowed Davids Harp weaves poetry with personal story, offering fresh insight into everyday scripture readings. Rebecca reminds readers that the Bible is not a 12-step self-help book, but rather a relationship with a personal God, who yearns for His people to smile at the future, and the now. Youll find I Borrowed Davids Harp a pure joy to read, not only once, but over and over.&lt;br&gt;
Cornelia Becker Seigneur, speaker and author of &lt;br&gt;
Images of America: WEST LINN and WriterMom Tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written, biblically sound, with wonderful insight. Every page drew me in, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to deepen their faith and strengthen their walk with God.&lt;br&gt;

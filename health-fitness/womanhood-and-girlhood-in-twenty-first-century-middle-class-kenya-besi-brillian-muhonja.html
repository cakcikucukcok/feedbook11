  <title>Womanhood and Girlhood in Twenty-First-Century Middle Class Kenya - Besi Brillian Muhonja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study of twenty first century girlhoods and womanhoods charts a new area of scholarship on Kenya. The chapters investigate questions related to how new rituals of girlhood and womanhood that materialize when religious, indigenous, and foreign worlds encounter each other are re-structuring family and society, recasting roles, and informing fresh conceptualizations of African girlhood and womanhood. The author&amp;rsquo;s interdisciplinary analysis and writing journeys through the different stages of girlhood and womanhood as ritualized by Kenya&amp;rsquo;s 21st century middle class, and teases out the implications of these peculiarities to identity (re)creation and the restructuring of societies&amp;rsquo; organs, and traditionally gendered institutions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Applying a critical African studies lens, the arguments in this book center women as originators of action and thought without inquiring into a male other. Essentially, this work disrupts patri-centered constructions and examinations of female bodies and identities. The resulting deductions inform on the substratum of Kenyan girls and women&amp;rsquo;s self-definitions as manifest through their experiences and ritualized practices, and articulate the impact of the performances of these bodies and identities on Kenyan and global societies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

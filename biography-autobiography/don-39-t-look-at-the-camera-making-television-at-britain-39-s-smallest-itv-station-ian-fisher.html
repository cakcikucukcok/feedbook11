  <title>Don&#39;t Look at the Camera: Making television at Britain&#39;s smallest ITV station - Ian Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Look at the Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;tells the extraordinary inside story of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to spend a lifetime making television. Ian Fisher is an international award winning producer/director who started his television career as a news reporter and presenter. This first volume of his memoirs is an often hilarious, sometimes emotional journey through a series of adventures, regular occurrences in his working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reporter he impersonated a cabinet minister to secure an interview with the Home Secretary, tracked down Richard Branson&amp;rsquo;s balloon at the end of his record-breaking trans-Atlantic flight, faced down a farmer who threatened to shoot him with a shotgun, and led the first television crew into Lockerbie after Pan Am Flight 103 crashed onto the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His programme-making exploits have been no less interesting, leading to encounters with some of the world&amp;rsquo;s top experts in their specialisms. He tells of the man who masterminded the US hydrogen bomb project, whose first encouraging words on meeting him at the end of a five thousand mile journey were, &amp;quot;You know I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this&amp;quot;, and of the scientist whose pipe set fire to his sports jacket half way through the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher says he&amp;rsquo;s been lucky that the predominant sound in the crew vehicles and edit suites he&amp;rsquo;s worked from has been laughter, and it finds its way into this book. But it&amp;rsquo;s not exclusively a light-hearted take on life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His involvement in covering the funeral of an 11 year old girl, murdered by a serial killer who the police took years to track down, is a heart rending story. And the description of events at Lockerbie on the night of the crash and over the subsequent days gives a unique insight into the pressures and dangers faced by journalists and crews reporting on world-level events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher has picked up a wide range of awards over the course of his career, including two medals from the prestigious New York Film &amp;amp; Television Festival, and his knowledge and experience are woven into the very fabric of this book. Don&amp;rsquo;t Look at the Camera will have you laughing and weeping. But you&amp;rsquo;ll also marvel at how much one person can fit in to a single life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

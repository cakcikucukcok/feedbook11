  <title>Retribution - Anne Schlea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Antonia Paige has been ripped out of vampire retirement, and shes not happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in her life agrees Antonia was given control of her familys clan when she was far too young. And after a couple of centuries of doing a mediocre job, Antonia has managed to vanish from her family and vampire society. She lands at a small North Georgia college with a plan: through scientific experiment, she will attempt to remove the vampire virus from her system. If she is successful, she can be human again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, its much harder for the head of a clan to disappear than Antonia realizes. Her brother Richard wants the crown for himself, but to take it, he must take out his sister. He tracks her down, but luckily for Antonia, a lover she jilted long ago is hovering nearby, waiting for an opportunity to rescue her. Antonia has learned a lot during her years living as a human, however, and she doesnt want to be rescuedshe wants to prove herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

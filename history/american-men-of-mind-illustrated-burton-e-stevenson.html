  <title>American Men of Mind (Illustrated) - Burton E. Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the companion volume of this series, &amp;ldquo;Men of Action, &amp;ldquo; the&lt;br /&gt;
attempt was made to give the essential facts of American history by&lt;br /&gt;
sketching in broad outline the men who made that history&amp;mdash;the&lt;br /&gt;
discoverers, pioneers, presidents, statesmen, soldiers, and sailors&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
and describing the part which each of them played.&lt;br /&gt;
It was almost like watching a great building grow under the hands&lt;br /&gt;
of the workmen, this one adding a stone and that one adding&lt;br /&gt;
another; but there was one great difference. For a building, the plans&lt;br /&gt;
are made carefully beforehand, worked out to the smallest detail,&lt;br /&gt;
and followed to the letter, so that every stone goes exactly where it&lt;br /&gt;
belongs, and the work of all the men fits together into a complete&lt;br /&gt;
and perfect whole. But when America was started, no one had more&lt;br /&gt;
than the vaguest idea of what the finished result was to be; indeed,&lt;br /&gt;
many questioned whether any enduring structure could be reared on&lt;br /&gt;
a foundation such as ours. So there was much useless labor, one&lt;br /&gt;
workman tearing down what another had built, and only a few of&lt;br /&gt;
them working with any clear vision of the future." />

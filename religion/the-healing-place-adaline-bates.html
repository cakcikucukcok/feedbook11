  <title>The Healing Place - Adaline Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was designed to provide you with helpful tools and direction for positioning yourself to be able to receive the healing you desire. Far too often we get in our own way and prevent healing from taking place in our lives. We think it is God not doing his job, when in reality we have not positioned ourselves to be able to receive healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the process within The Healing Place will finally get you positioned to be set free from the inner hurt and darkness that robs you of life. It is also great material to use for small groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is purposely an easy read so you can go back over particular parts that you may need to revisit. This book includes devotionals that are not necessarily one for each day. Stay on each one as long as you need to, so your process is effective. It will be very beneficial to you if you journal each day. Pages are included within the devotional journal for that purpose. If you need more space than what is provided, start a notebook. Dont limit yourself. Getting it out is a big part of the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;" />

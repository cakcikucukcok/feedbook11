&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High&amp;rdquo; is a communication and self-help book written by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler. In it, the authors explain different techniques on how to remain calm during a conversation and obtain the desired results. The book includes a six-minute technique to prepare for high-impact events and it teaches how to make it safe to discuss different topics, including controversial ones. It also explains the ways in which a person can sound persuasive instead of abrasive and how to keep listening when the other person loses control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Crucial Conversations&amp;rdquo; sold over 3 million copies worldwide and was a New York Times bestseller. There is currently an updated second edition available, with new case studies and research, and a foreword by Stephen R. Covey, author of &amp;ldquo;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

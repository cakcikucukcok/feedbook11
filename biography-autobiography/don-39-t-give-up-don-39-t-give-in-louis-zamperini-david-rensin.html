  <title>Don&#39;t Give Up, Don&#39;t Give In - Louis Zamperini, David Rensin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than 100,000 copies in print&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completed just two days before Louis Zamperini&amp;#8217;s death at age ninety-seven, &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Give Up, Don&amp;#8217;t Give In&lt;/em&gt; shares a lifetime of wisdom, insight, and humor from &amp;#8220;one of the most incredible American lives of the past century&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;). Zamperini&amp;#8217;s story has touched millions through Laura Hillenbrand&amp;#8217;s biography &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; and its blockbuster movie adaptation directed by Angelina Jolie. Now, in his own words, Zamperini reveals with warmth and great charm the essential values and lessons that sustained him throughout his remarkable journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a youthful troublemaker from California who turned his life around to become a 1936 Olympian. Putting aside his track career, he volunteered for the army before Pearl Harbor and was thrust into World War II as a B-24 bombardier. While on a rescue mission, his plane went down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where he survived against all odds, drifting two thousand miles in a small raft for forty-seven days. His struggle was only beginning: Zamperini was captured by the Japanese, and for more than two years he courageously endured torture and psychological abuse in a series of prisoner-of-war camps. He returned home to face more dark hours, but in 1949 Zamperini&amp;#8217;s life was transformed by a spiritual rebirth that would guide him through the next sixty-five years of his long and happy life. Louis Zamperini&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Give Up, Don&amp;#8217;t Give In&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinary last testament that captures the wisdom of a life lived to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;" />

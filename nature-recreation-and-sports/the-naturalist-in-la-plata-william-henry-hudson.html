  <title>The Naturalist In La Plata - William Henry Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Naturalist In La Plata&quot; is a collection of essays by Argentinian naturalist William Henry Hudson, first published in 1895. They primarily concern the Pampas, an area in the South American lowlands where Hudson grew up, and constitute a masterful blend of scientific content and interesting stories, anecdotes, and other titbits from his observations of the area. Contents include: &quot;The Desert Pampas&quot;, &quot;Cub Puma, Or Lion Of America&quot;, &quot;Wave Of Life&quot;, &quot;Some Curious Animal Weapons&quot;, &quot;Fear In Birds Parental And Early Instincts&quot;, &quot;The Mephitic Skunk&quot;, &quot;Mimicry And Warning Colours In Grasshoppers&quot;, &quot;Dragon-fly&quot;, &quot;Storms&quot;, and &quot;Mosquitoes And Parasite Problems&quot;. William Henry Hudson (1841 - 1922) was an Argentinian naturalist, author, and ornithologist. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is best known for his novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904). Other notable works include &quot;A Crystal Age&quot; (1887) and &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918), which has since been adapted into a film. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />

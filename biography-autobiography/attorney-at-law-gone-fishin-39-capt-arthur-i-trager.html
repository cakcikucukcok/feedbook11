  <title>Attorney at Law: Gone Fishin&#39; - Capt. Arthur I. Trager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Feel the passion and intensity of big game fishing. Fish for the much sought after and elusive king of the ocean, the blue marlin.&lt;p&gt;
In this true story, experience the determination of a seasoned attorney with a successful law practice and an advancing career in politics who risked it all to seek inner peace. He faced
the challenges of starting a new career at mid-life with little experience in a field seemingly far removed from human strife and politics. Travel to the Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, the
Caribbean, and South America with the author in his quest, and share the adventure, disappointment, and excitement of negotiating uncharted waters along a journey to fulfillment.
Know the contentment that comes from a job well done. Capt. Trager earned his reputation as competitor in sportfishing circles on the east coast of Florida, Bahamas and the Caribbean by being the winning captain in six major blue marlin tournaments, Bimini Wahoo Tournament and a contender in many other events he entered during his fishing career. The author is now retired and living in South Carolina." />

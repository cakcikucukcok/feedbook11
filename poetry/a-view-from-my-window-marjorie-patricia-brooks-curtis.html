  <title>A View from My Window - Marjorie Patricia Brooks Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In A View from My Window, Marjories poems run the gamut from childlike innocence to adult maturity on through older age.  Themes range from skepticism to deep faith, from playfulness to dead seriousness, from admonishing the wayward to acceptance of people in all condition of life.
In the collection of poems, no topic is too mundane or too minute to expound upon e.g., a ray of sunshine or a garden gnome.  Marjorie writes poignantly about excessive eating and weight gain, loss of loved ones, relationship problems, loneliness and despair, as well as exuberant joy in nature, friends, family, travel, and memories of bygone days.
Upon reading the poems, one can tell that Marjorie enjoys life, even with its heartache and uncertainty, and that she is a keen observer of people.
Marjorie Curtis was born and raised in Aliceville, Alabama.  She presently lives in Greenwood, Mississippi." />

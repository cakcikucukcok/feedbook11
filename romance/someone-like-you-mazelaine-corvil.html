  <title>Someone Like You - Mazelaine Corvil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Friendship
Kari had always thought nothing could come between her and Sandra since theyve been friends since middle school. Sandra was more of a sister to her or so she thought. The two had always had a close relationship which was about to change when Sandra encountered her high school crush Yahim. Kari was shock to see how a man could change everything between them, and to find out that their friendship was not really how she thought it was.
Friendship and love
Kari and Kevin had one thing that bonded them together; it was their rough childhood years that scarred their hearts, but other than that they were completely different people. Life has a way to put a twist in every story when they both ended up falling in love with each other, but they both knew there was a big gap of differences between them. Kevin did not meet Karis expectations of the man she wanted in her life, while Kevin thought Kari was not near his match.  Kari found herself getting attach to the mysterious man when her and Sandras friendship was falling apart." />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hunted series continues as Special Agent Sam Turner discovers that protecting the FBI&amp;#39;s star witness is more difficult than he thought!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakery owner Elizabeth Hamilton&amp;#39;s quiet life is filled with sweet treats, good friends, and a loving family. But all of that is about to turn sour when an odd sound draws her outside. There&amp;#39;s a man lying unconscious in the street, a car speeding toward him. Without hesitation, she gets the man out of harm&amp;#39;s way before they&amp;#39;re run down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unwittingly, Elizabeth has put herself in the path of a serial murderer, and as the only one who can identify the FBI&amp;#39;s Silver Fox Killer, she&amp;#39;s ended up in the hospital with a target on her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that stands between her and death is Special Agent Sam Turner. Against his better judgment, Sam gets emotionally involved, determined to take down the double threat against Elizabeth&amp;#8212;an ex desperate to get her back, despite a restraining order, and a psychopath bent on silencing her before she can identify him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They set a trap to catch the killer&amp;#8212;putting Elizabeth in his hands, with Sam desperate to save her. If he&amp;#39;s lucky, he&amp;#39;ll get his man . . . and the girl.&lt;/p&gt;" />

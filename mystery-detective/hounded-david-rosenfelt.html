  <title>Hounded - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andy Carpenter isn&#39;t sure what to think when he gets a mysterious phone call from a good friend, policeman Pete Stanton, asking him to drop everything, drive to an unfamiliar address, and bring his girlfriend, Laurie Collins. He certainly isn&#39;t expecting to show up at a crime scene. But that&#39;s exactly where he arrives--at the house where Pete has just discovered the body of ex-convict Danny Diza. Upstairs are Danny&#39;s now orphaned eight-year-old son and basset hound. And that, Andy discovers, is why he and Laurie were called to the scene--Pete wants them to take care of the boy and the dog so they won&#39;t get thrown into the &quot;system.&quot; This is already asking a lot, but soon Pete needs another big favor from Andy. Pete himself has come under suspicion for Danny&#39;s murder, and he needs defense attorney Andy to represent him...and to find out what really happened in Danny&#39;s house that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Rosenfelt has done it again. Told with his characteristic humor and wit, &lt;i&gt;Hounded&lt;/i&gt; is at once a heartfelt story about family and a page-turning legal thriller.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Shyster&#39;s Daughter - Paula Priamos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Paula Priamos&#39; &lt;I&gt;The Shyster&#39;s Daughter&lt;/I&gt; is a wonderfully written charged memoir&amp;#151;utterly absorbing and packed with sharp details. Direct, evocative, emotionally honest, brave, and funny, Priamos&#39; voice shines. &lt;I&gt;The Shyster&#39;s Daughter&lt;/I&gt; is a suspenseful investigative journey, but its emotional core vibrates with Priamos&#39; homage to her deeply flawed and deeply loved father, and to their complicated and enduring relationship.&quot;&amp;#151;Victoria Patterson, author of &lt;I&gt;This Vacant Paradise&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Drift&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The last time my father calls is shortly before the anniversary of his disbarment to tell me he&#39;s just cheated death. On his end, there&#39;s background noise&amp;#151;a restaurant, a bar or somewhere far sleazier. Since the divorce he licks his wounds at a topless strip club in Garden Grove called the Kat Nip.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Shyster&#39;s Daughter&lt;/I&gt; is a detective memoir of a Greek family living in Southern California in the late 1900s. The author, whose father was an attorney with clients who were often questionable characters knowing a side of him unseen by his family, looks into his death and finds more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Paula Priamos&lt;/B&gt;&#39; writing has been featured in various magazines and in the anthology &lt;I&gt;Naming the World: And Other Exercises for the Creative Writer&lt;/I&gt;. She teaches at California State University and lives in Southern California with her husband and stepsons. This is her first book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

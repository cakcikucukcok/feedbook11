  <title>The Matchmakers&#39; Daddy (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Judy Duarte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;WHEN HE HELD HER, HE HELD EVERYTHING HE WANTED…AND COULD NEVER HAVE.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;d done his time, for a crime he hadn&#39;t committed, and now Zack Henderson was ready for a fresh start. With a good job, some savings and weekends with his little girl, his prospects were bright. But this rugged ex-con&#39;s plan for a new life hadn&#39;t included falling for two adorable neighborhood girls–or their beautiful mother. Diana Lynch was the kind of woman he knew he couldn&#39;t have–a good girl, a true lady. And in her arms he almost felt like some kind of hero. Problem was, he knew she was better off without a man like him…no matter what his heart–or Diana&#39;s two little matchmakers–had to say.&lt;/p&gt;

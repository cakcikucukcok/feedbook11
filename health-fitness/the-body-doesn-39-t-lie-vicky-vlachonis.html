While the immediate reaction to pain is to take short-term measures to make it go away, this does nothing to address the underlying cause. Vlachonis shows us how to locate the source of our pain, understand its origin and manifestation in the body, and then let it go for good, using a holistic approach that includes easy-to-implement approaches to diet, exercise, and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlachonis&amp;#8217; proven and successful pain eradication program was developed over years working with a wide range of clients, from celebrities and CEOs to overworked ballerinas and working moms. The book includes a detailed meal plan with recipes, body maps to identify areas of pain and healing touch points, and step-by-step remedies for specific issues including fatigue, digestive problems, and depression. This groundbreaking approach uses pain as a tool&amp;#8212;not the undefeatable enemy&amp;#8212;to help you look and feel better immediately, and release your body from physical and emotional pain for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />

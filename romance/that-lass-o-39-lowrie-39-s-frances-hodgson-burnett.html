      <meta name="description" content="Frances Eliza Hodgson Burnett (24 November 1849&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 29 October 1924) was a British-American novelist and playwright. She is best known for the three children&amp;#39;s novels Little Lord Fauntleroy (published in 1885&amp;ndash;1886), A Little&amp;nbsp;Princess (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911).Frances Eliza Hodgson was born in Cheetham, Manchester, England. After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 emigrated to the United States, settling near Knoxville, Tennessee. There Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines from the age of 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 Frances married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to live in Washington, D.C. Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (That Lass o&amp;#39; Lowrie&amp;#39;s), was published to good reviews. Little Lord Fauntleroy was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children&amp;#39;s fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped\ to produce stage versions of Little Lord Fauntleroy and A&amp;nbsp;Little Princess." />

  <title>Faith &amp; Hope Poems - Shirley Ann Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As each of us learns to walk, talk, and feed ourselves, we also need to learn how to understand each other so that we can help ourselves and those around us. 
&lt;i&gt;Faith and Hope Poems&lt;/i&gt; presents a new poetry collection based upon author Shirley Ann Woods soul searching in response to this need. These poems offer personal reflections and simple statements of her own feelings on life. Because of a near death experience at the age of five, she has a great desire to honor God in her life. With these verses, Wood shares her deepest, most spiritual thoughts.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Letter to Jesus&lt;/b&gt;
Dear Jesus your love is so sweet
It enfolds me and life is complete
I came to the cross, bewildered and lost
And laid all I was at your feet
You looked with compassion and love
Held me up to the Father above
Saidbehold she is mine
In our nature divine she is cleansed
And restored in our love
Then the spirit descended on me
Broke the chains that I might be free
Now the Lord dwells within
I am filled to the brim
And the glory of God now I see &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />

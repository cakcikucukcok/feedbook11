  <title>The Denial of Science - Martin Lack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is not a book about climate science.&lt;br /&gt;Rather it analyses why some people dispute the reality, reliability and&lt;br /&gt;reasonableness of this science. The validity of the scientifi c consensus&lt;br /&gt;is therefore taken as a given, solely in order to analyse the views of&lt;br /&gt;climate change sceptics who dispute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, most biological and environmental scientists do agree&lt;br /&gt;that the scale of much human activity now exceeds the capacity of our&lt;br /&gt;environment to sustain it, or to recycle the waste it generates. Using a&lt;br /&gt;river as a source of water, a laundry and a toilet may be possible if you&lt;br /&gt;live in a sparsely populated wilderness. If you live in a slum, however, it&lt;br /&gt;is likely to lead to your premature death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, many activities have become problematic simply because&lt;br /&gt;of the rate at which we are carrying them out. This includes pumping&lt;br /&gt;carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Therefore this book addresses&lt;br /&gt;the philosophical roots of scepticism, its possible misappropriation for&lt;br /&gt;ideological reasons, and the psychological causes of denial. It concludes&lt;br /&gt;by suggesting that ending this denial of science is an essential next step&lt;br /&gt;toward a sustainable future in a post-carbon era.&lt;/p&gt;" />

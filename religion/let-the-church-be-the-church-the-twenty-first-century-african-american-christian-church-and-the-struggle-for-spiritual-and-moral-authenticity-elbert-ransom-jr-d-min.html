  <title>Let the Church Be the Church: The Twenty First Century African American Christian Church and the Struggle for Spiritual and Moral Authenticity - Elbert Ransom, Jr., D. Min.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Let the Church Be the Church&quot; is a book that provides the reader with the author&#39;s&quot;  &quot;up close&quot; experience in many African-American Protestant churches throughout the United States of America over the past forty years.  He grew up in the African-American Baptist church while being raised by devoted Christian parents who made the church an integral part of the lives of their four children.  The book is an expose of the misunderstandings that many so-called Christians have of the church of today.  The holy Bible records Jesus Christ established the church upon Peter as an institution that &quot;the gates of Hades will not overcome it.&quot; Matt. 16:17b    Included are some spiritual and divine offerings to those who are in search of reclaiming God&#39;s church in hopes of kingdom building.  The author extends his revelation of the bold selfishness of those who claim to have been called by God to this gospel venture, but ended up in woe." />

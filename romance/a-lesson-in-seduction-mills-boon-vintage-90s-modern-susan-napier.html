  <title>A Lesson In Seduction (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Susan Napier</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Was he a shy guy… or playboy?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They met at the airport. He wore a suit and carried a briefcase. He seemed quiet, a little shy. Definitely not the type to flirt with a fellow passenger - even if she was famous actress Rosalind Marlow! His name, Roz discovered, was Luke James. She was determined to discover more about him… such as why he appeared to be following her. And was he as innocent as he seemed?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What he really needed was a lesson in flirtation - and, on impulse, Roz decided to be his teacher! Luke was a fast learner. In fact, Roz soon discovered that he didn&#39;t need lessons at all. He could teach her plenty about the art of seduction!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Susan Napier is a whizz at stirring up both breathtaking sensuality and emotional tension.&quot; - &lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book follows a six months journey of a Zulu man born under Apartheid and raised in the new South Africa.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It is set in&amp;nbsp;the first half of 2015 and captures Themba&amp;#39;s dream for a future beyond freedom.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The invitation to the reader is to believe in themselves and work together for change before it is too late.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; My dearest children,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I write this to be read on your twenty first birthday because I want you to understand why I was not able to fulfil my deepest desire to be a hands on dad. As you know I grew up without a father so understand how difficult this can be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; My father died in the pursuit of South Africa&amp;rsquo;s freedom from Apartheid. His dream seemed to be realised when Mandela became our president. However this slowly faded as the ANC started to put themselves ahead of their people.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As a reporter I was engaged in trying to keep the dream alive but when this became too dangerous your mother and I decided that she would take you out of the country.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I am pleased with how well you have settled and integrated into your new home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I love the people you have become but am overwhelmed with sadness that I had so little to do with your growing up years. The choice was mine. Your loss of connection with Africa and your heritage was the result. I am sorry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If only South Africans had been prepared to take democracy back while they had the chance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That is now past and it is time for you to hear the whole story.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Love&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Tata.&lt;/p&gt;" />

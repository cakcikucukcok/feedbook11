  <title>Analysis of Promising Altcoins - Orkhan Ahmadli, Taleh Ahmadov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is not a random analysis of existing altcoins in the market. Rather it is a product of months-long qualitative, financial, and descriptive analyses of promising altcoins in the market. The book refers to the &amp;ldquo;Blootbath&amp;rdquo; posterior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have opened this page and started reading this description, most probably, you already have decent knowledge on cryptocurrencies and benefits they can bring to our society. Even if you are not well-informed on their potential benefits, you definitely know what bitcoin is and have encountered stories of people getting rich overnight. True. Recently, we all read how 50 Cent, once discharged from bankruptcy, made over $7 million thanks to his bitcoin possessions. Winklevoss Twins became billionaires. Lamborghini is on the verge of a record number of sales in the US. The thing is that you also deserve to own your lambo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 years ago, days were also passing as they are doing now. We disregard the reality that today can just become another day bringing fortunes to millions of people in a couple of years. It is highly likely that several promising altcoins will create a new wave of millionaires in 5 years. At the same time, we definitely can relate to your uneasiness. It is hard to risk your hard earned income, years long saving for some sort of altcoins. We also know that you might be indifferent regarding your investment decisions in the face of dramatically plunging btc prices and prevailing &amp;ldquo;bloodbath&amp;rdquo; in the market. You might even be a risk averse person and avoid making investments to secure your assets. However, significant drops in btc prices and so called &amp;lsquo;bloodbath&amp;rdquo; are anything but a novel phenomenon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, we as experienced investors, qualified financial analysts, and professional consultants present:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Elaborated results of months-long financial, technical, qualitative, and descriptive analyses of existing altcoins&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;List of promising altcoins with justifications behind&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Specifically modeled forecasted prices and ROI considering market volatilities, historical patterns, comparative advantages, and potential threads&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Recommended portfolio breakdowns for each altcoin&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Technical analysis of BTC pairings in the market&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Platform comparisons based on accepted payment methods, reputation, and fees&lt;br /&gt;

We, Orkhan Ahmadli and Taleh Ahmadov are in no way related to the companies and individuals behind below-mentioned cryptocurrencies. This book is not intended to pump any altcoins and undermine the potentials of the remaining ones. The cryptocurrencies were selected based on qualitative and financial analyses of the existing altcoins. The arguments provided are a pure outcome of authors&amp;rsquo; analyses and should not be accepted as the ultimate truth on your investment decisions. In order to avoid a conflict of interest and assure an unbiased approach, we exchanged all our cryptocurrency holdings to fiat. As authors, we are ready to respond and refute any charges claiming opposite.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Fundraiser - Deborah Wheatley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="International French businessman Jean Philippe has it all, businesses both in Europe and the emerging third-world African countries. He enjoys the company of many diplomatic officials until he is accused of trafficking children from Africa into Europe and finds himself in a South African police station. He reaches out to an old friend, Nicky Brown, to help him track the missing children.
Nicky hasnt seen Jean Philippe in five years and wonders about his early morning call and at first is hesitant to help him. However, circumstances change, and with the help of her cousin Brinley Brown, a renowned gangster and drug dealer, they manage to get their first clue as to where to start the search.
The clue takes them from South Africa to Italy, Algeria, and finally Paris. During this time their already complicated friendship becomes even more so during their journey to find the truth." />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Is a real man too hot for a pampered diva to handle?.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Kaitlyn Strong, life has been a fun-filled free ride, all expenses paid by her wealthy father. As for relationships, why would Kaitlyn want to give up the fabulous single life? But after she goes on her most outrageous spending bender yet, she&#39;s informed it&#39;s time to make her own way. For a shocked Kaitlyn, that means getting a job--and an affordable apartment to go with it.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard-working single father Quinton Wells is proud of his job looking after a small apartment building. But he&#39;s never met a demanding diva like his new tenant, Kaitlyn. Yet despite their verbal clashes, there&#39;s a sizzling attraction between them. And there&#39;s a budding friendship between Kaitlyn and Quint&#39;s teen daughter, who needs a woman in her life. Quint needs a woman in his life too, and as the red hot desire between him and Kaitlyn builds, the only choice left is to surrender.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bryant reintroduces her readers to the Strong family in her latest novel, which has all of her trademarks: hot men, spicy women and a sexually captivating story.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Hot Like Fire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Niobia Bryant enthralls readers.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Books2Mention Magazine &lt;/i&gt;" />

  <title>The Writer&#39;s Digest Guide To Query Letters - Wendy Burt-Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make That Crucial, Positive First Impression&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Anyone who&#39;s researched the marketplace knows: The path to publication begins with your query letter. If your query is weak, unfocused, or uninspired, an editor or agent won&#39;t even bother to request your article, novel manuscript, or nonfiction book proposal. But a well-crafted, compelling query sent to the right editor or agent is an essential sales tool for fiction writers and the most effective way for nonfiction writers to pre-sell your idea. &lt;p&gt;    In this book, professional freelance writer and magazine editor Wendy Burt-Thomas shares practical advice on how to craft persuasive letters that connect with editors and agents and ultimately generate sales for you. You&#39;ll learn how to:&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Conduct targeted research to find suitable editors and agents  &lt;li&gt;Hook an editor with a tantalizing lead and shape a summary that compels editors to buy  &lt;li&gt;Select the strongest slant for your book or article  &lt;li&gt;Use research and interview shortcuts that keep your query prep profitable  &lt;li&gt;Make your query rejection-proof by weeding out subtle mistakes that can sabotage your project  &lt;li&gt;Communicate your author platform and sell yourself as the best writer for the subject&lt;/ul&gt;    Complete with dozens of sample queries&amp;#150some that landed article assignments, agents, or book deals, and others that never stood a chance&amp;#150this book offers you a comprehensive strategy for presenting your writing ideas in a way that will increase your chances of publication. Though the title may lead some to believe it&#39;s strictly to be shelved as a reference manual, &lt;i&gt;The Writer&#39;s Digest Guide to Query Letters&lt;/i&gt; is a smooth read from cover to cover." />

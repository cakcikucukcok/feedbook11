  <title>Stories from My Garden - Rita Curry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you struggling with depression, anxiety, discouragement, or stress of any kind? If so, you will want to read Rita Currys book, Stories From My Garden. Rita has suffered from these same conditions, and more. In fact, according to one psychological evaluation, she was close to lapsing into a catatonic state. She has, however, made great gains in her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of Ritas recovery was achieved while working in her garden. As she observed the beauty there, and then listened in her heart to what the Lord Jesus was teaching her through that beauty, Rita composed the stories that you can read in her book. She says that she has been blessed with the wonderful stories, and she wants to share them with you. Each story, she says, has shown her another facet of the Lords love. Rita is sure that the stories will speak to you, too, and help you with your own recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find hope for your difficulties and encouragement in your trials in Rita Currys book, Stories From My Garden.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Magic to Memphis: What if your life is working from the inside out? - starr julie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Music, murder and everyday magic  Jessie is seventeen years old, a runaway musician living rough in a trailer with a pit bull dog called Bear. That&#39;s fine by Jessie; she&#39;s got big plans. A music contest in Memphis offers the chance of money, fame and escape from a nowhere town with no real prospects. Turns out there&#39;s more in Memphis than music. When Jessie&#39;s mom sends her a box of things belonging to her dad, she finds out that he made the same trip years ago. She&#39;s determined to find him, but has no idea that the ring her dad left her is being hunted by a sadistic killer. Nor does she realize that he will stop at nothing to get it back. Suddenly, a simple music contest turns into a fight for survival and only a puzzling traveler called Finch has the answers Jessie needs. But will she listen? And can she trust in herself enough to change her luck and make magic happen?" />

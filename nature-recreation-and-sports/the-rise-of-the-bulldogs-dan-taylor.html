  <title>The Rise of the Bulldogs - Dan Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;The Rise of the Bulldogs&lt;/em&gt; tells the extraordinary story of the unranked 2008 Fresno State Bulldogs and their remarkable journey from a seemingly lost season to NCAA National Champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baseball fans across America were held spellbound by Fresno State&#39;s nail-biting and improbable adventure through the NCAA playoffs. A record viewing audience of almost 2 million households tuned in to ESPN&#39;s live coverage as Fresno State grabbed their crown. Now in this gripping on-the-field account, readers can experience what &lt;em&gt;Baseball America&lt;/em&gt; magazine columnist John Manuel described as &quot;the biggest upset winners in College World Series history, perhaps all of college sports.&quot; Only a handful of people close to the team know the inside truth about the turmoil&amp;#8212;the injuries, the conflicts, and the betrayals that took place during the Bulldogs&#39; momentous season. Television sportscaster Dan Taylor is one of those insiders, and he reveals the real story in these pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor shows how late-season tumult forced a reevaluation of the commitment, direction, and relationships among the players themselves; how the team bonded as a unit and developed leadership from within; and how these changes led to a positive and carefree brand of baseball. Ultimately, the group found the belief they needed in one another in the midst of the most unlikely crowning of a national champion in the history of collegiate sports. This is the ultimate underdog story, with a long shot coming out on top against overwhelming odds.&lt;/p&gt;" />

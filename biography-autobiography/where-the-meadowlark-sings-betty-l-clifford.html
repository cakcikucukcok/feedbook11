  <title>Where the Meadowlark Sings - Betty L. Clifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Familythe very word evokes foundation, roots, genealogy, warmth, and belonging.  A family is a treasured gift from God, our heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to circumstances beyond our control, our family was broken by our mother&#39;s untimely death.  By faith and God&#39;s grace, our father was able to keep us together as a family unit.  It takes much prayer and wisdom to raise a child and especially four of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in my own elder years, I am very thankful for this gift.  How very empty and alone I would have been without knowing my father and brothers.  Without being a part of this common ancestry and lineage.  Wondering forever: Who am I?  Why am I here?  Instead I have inherited this unity, singleness of heart and bond of understanding that begins on the day of birth upon bonding with mother and father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family! Treasure it. Hold each member to your heart and never let them go.&lt;/p&gt;" />

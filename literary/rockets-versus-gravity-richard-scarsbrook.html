  <title>Rockets Versus Gravity - Richard Scarsbrook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;National Post&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller!&lt;br/&gt;
A multi-faceted story that explores how small actions and changes can give rise to startling and unintended consequences.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Trajectory. Declination. Impact. Escape Velocity. These are rocketry terms that could also describe aspects of the human experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A lumberjack obsessed with space travel loses four different wedding rings, and each of the lost rings symbolizes something different to the person who finds it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There are the members of a rich family whose dramas overlap with those of the homeless people living right next door, under the bridges of the Rosedale Ravine. The wheelchair-bound teen who declares war on a man parking his luxury car in the handicapped parking spot. The would-be rock star selling insurance, whose terminal diagnosis sets his life on a new and dizzying path. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
And many others. Every person is connected to every other — genetically, coincidentally, necessarily, or randomly. Every action has a consequence, seen or unseen, from the sublime to the catastrophic." />

As always, Richard Scarsbrook creates a bunch of quirky characters, including Stan and Sheila, the unhappy couple whose rings connect the stories, and teenage Clementine, whose name, like everything else in her life, is recycled.<br /><b><i>Rockets Versus Gravity by Richard Scarsbrook</i></b> | Embracing ideas of synchronicity and chaos theory, Scarsbrook jumps around in time and place (Subterrain) Rockets Versus Gravity was a good read, it took me less than a day to read it because I was so curious to see where it was going to go.

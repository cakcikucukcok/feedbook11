      <meta name="description" content="Damien had changed a lot in the years following his mother&#39;s mysterious accident and during his dad&#39;s constant training to make him the perfect fighter for his secret organization that Damien will join one day if he is worthy. He&#39;s not been able to have the life of a normal teenager because of these. Because he and his father are always moving from one city to another, Damien is unable to make any real friends. He eventually gives up trying. He also gives up trying to live by his father&#39;s harsh rules, and he tries to do what many others have attempted when they gave up hope. But he is saved at the last minute. And having the will to live again he finds something he thought he could never have: love. And only good things can come from love... most of the time." />

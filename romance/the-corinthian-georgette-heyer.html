  <title>The Corinthian - Georgette Heyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;A writer of great wit and style...I&#39;ve read her books to ragged shreds.&quot;-Kate Fenton, &lt;em&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A daring escape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penelope Creed will do anything to avoid marrying her repulsive cousin. Dressed in boy&#39;s clothing, she&#39;s fleeing from London when she&#39;s discovered by Sir Richard Wyndham, himself on the verge of the most momentous decision of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And a heroic rescue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sir Richard encounters the lovely young fugitive, he knows he can&#39;t allow her to travel to the countryside all alone, so he offers himself as her protector. As it happens, at that very moment Sir Richard could use an escape of his own...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Readers Say:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Marvelous screwball comedy and great romance!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lighthearted and fun, full of adventure and misadventure.

  <title>Meg &amp; Linus - Hanna Nowinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can friendship, Star Trek, drama club, and a whole lot of coffee get two nerdy best friends through the beginning of their senior year of high school?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg and Linus are best friends bound by a shared love of school, a coffee obsession, and being queer. It&#39;s not always easy to be the nerdy lesbian or gay kid in a suburban town. But they have each other. And a few Star Trek boxed sets. They&#39;re pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Sophia, Meg&#39;s longtime girlfriend, breaks up with Meg. Linus starts tutoring the totally dreamy new kid, Danny--and Meg thinks setting them up is the perfect project to distract herself from her own heartbreak. But Linus isn&#39;t so sure Danny even likes guys, and maybe Sophia isn&#39;t quite as out of the picture as Meg thought she was. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From crowdsourced young adult imprint Swoon Reads comes &lt;i&gt;Meg &amp; Linus &lt;/i&gt;by Hanna Nowinski, a fun friendship story about two quirky teens who must learn to get out of their comfort zones and take risks--even if that means joining the drama club, making new friends, and learning how to stand on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Meg and Linus&lt;/i&gt;, from the Swoon Reads community:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I also love that &lt;b&gt;friendship takes center stage&lt;/b&gt; in this story. . . . &lt;b&gt;I didn&#39;t want the story to end!&lt;/b&gt; Such a beautiful story.&quot; --Rita, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I liked that both characters are queer, and while it is a part of the story, it&#39;s not the story itself. . . . It&#39;s &lt;b&gt;delightfully refreshing&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; --Tammy Wanzer, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What made this unique was the &lt;b&gt;strong friendship&lt;/b&gt; between the two narrators (who were not romantically interested in each other), and how that friendship influenced their romances with their partners. It was also refreshing to have &lt;b&gt;LGBT representation that was beyond stereotypes&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; --Julia Durrant, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book is a really lovely story about&lt;b&gt; young love and being true to yourself despite the pressures to conform&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; --Jill Watkins, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Get ready to fall in love with two oddball nerdy best friends&lt;/b&gt;. . . . This adorable, warm hearted contemporary YA is&lt;b&gt; tremendously funny&lt;/b&gt;, and full of some seriously swoony moments. . . . The world needs more diverse love stories, whether that be long time girlfriends working through some issues, first crushes or friendships.&quot; --Charlie, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;" />

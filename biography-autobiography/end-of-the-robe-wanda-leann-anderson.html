  <title>End of the Robe - Wanda Leann Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After every open door in her life appeared to slam shut, Sienna Andrews made the decision to leave her family and friends in Southern California to start a new life in Minnetonka, Minnesota. At first, there seemed to be a turnaround in her life, but it wasnt long before she found herself lost in a whirlwind of depression and self-hatred. Siennas closest friend, Abigail, noticed that her friend was in trouble and convinced Sienna to admit herself into a local hospital. Sienna agreed to check herself into the hospital, and things quickly went from bad to worse. It was the moment in her bathroom where Sienna found herself at the end of it all; at the &lt;i&gt;End of the Robe&lt;/i&gt;. Will she cave under the self-loathing pressure to commit suicide? Or in those last moments, will she cry out to God for his love and help? Is the &lt;i&gt;End of the Robe&lt;/i&gt; the end of it all for Sienna?" />

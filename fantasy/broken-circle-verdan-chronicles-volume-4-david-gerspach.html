  <title>Broken Circle: Verdan Chronicles: Volume 4 - David Gerspach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The war in Verdan is over. The death of Terek at Mount Bardoom has brought the world together and made the various races realize they can no longer live in isolation. But the peace promised by The Fourth Age is one they will still need to earn.   In the frozen wastelands to the north there are those who seek to cheat death. If successful, they plan to reshape the world. Standing in their way is the same wizard whose death was recently celebrated, but now may be needed to protect those he once fought.   In Izmir, a mysterious theft at Mount Bardoom sends the Lady Y&#39;Shanarra on a quest and a collision course with those same schemes and ambitions.   Trevor, finally reunited with his long lost son, seeks to return to Parthea. But first, he is reunited with friends and becomes entangled in a goblin revolution. And if recent revelations are true, it is goblin history which may yet provide clues to Verdan&#39;s future." />

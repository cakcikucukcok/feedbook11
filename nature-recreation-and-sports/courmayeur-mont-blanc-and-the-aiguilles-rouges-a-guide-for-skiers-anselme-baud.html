  <title>Courmayeur - Mont Blanc and the Aiguilles Rouges - a Guide for Skiers - Anselme Baud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover the skiing downhills of the Courtmayeur Mountain in this very detailed and documented book, written by one of the most talented skiers of his generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located at the very heart of the highest mountains of Europe, the majestic Courtmayeur massif stands as a reference among the most sacred skiing places in the world. When winter comes, this snow-addict heaven offers a unique range of dream slopes, from the easiest to the most breathtakingly high ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anselme Baud is an extreme skiing leading head and one of the best experts of this mountain. From classic skiing hikes to mountaineering competitions, this guide book presents a precise description of all the biggest slopes this mythic area could offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this volume you can find all the information about Courmayeur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks to his charming accounts and instructive advice, Anselme Baud shares with us his precious and wide experience as a high mountain guide and an exceptional skier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in Morzine in 1948, Anselme Baud left his mark on the Alps skiing steep slopes history. As a high mountain guide in 1973, he was one the first to ski on extreme downhills in the Alps, the Andes, in Antarctica or in the Himalayas. As an ENSA professor, he supervised during several years the mountain guides trainings in Bolivia and Nepal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Italian part of the Mont Blanc Massif (Val Ferret and Val Veni) is home to some of the most imposing 4000m peaks in the Alps. While the Aiguille des Glaciers, Tre la Tête peaks and the Miage on the west face are great for skiing, few of the descents around Mont Blanc itself are regularly skied. Thanks to the relative ease of access to the Col du Géant there are numerous possible routes ranging from the Vallée Blanche to the magnificent, steep faces and couloirs nearby. To the east, on the Grandes Jorasses and on Mont Gruetta, there are a couple of major descents that are often skied. Finally, there is the Mont Dolent sector which forms the border with Switzerland and has a number of routes. Its altitude meant that the Col du Géant sector was a summer ski area until 1988." />

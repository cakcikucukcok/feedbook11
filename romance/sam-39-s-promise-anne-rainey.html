  <title>Sam&#39;s Promise - Anne Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam Jennings has come home for Thanksgiving to find the family business on the brink of bankruptcy and his mother fighting for her life. As he sets out to put things right with the business, The Blackwater Restaurant, he runs into his first snag--in the form of a curvy brunette. Julie Rose might be the best waitress in Blackwater, but she has more thorns than a damn porcupine. So why can&#39;t Sam stop thinking about her long legs and sassy mouth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julie isn&#39;t about to get mixed up with her boss&#39;s son. He might be tall, dark, and handsome, but he&#39;s way too arrogant and not at all her type. Sam is as hard as steel and just about as cuddly as a bear. Besides, between her business classes and waitressing, Julie has very little energy left over for playtime. Too bad her libido hasn&#39;t gotten the memo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each novella in the Blackwater Series is a standalone story and can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Sam&#39;s Promise&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Vance&#39;s Rules&lt;br&gt;Book 3: Breaking Brodix&lt;br&gt;Book 4: Reilly&#39;s Wildcard&lt;br&gt;Book 5: River&#39;s Redemption&lt;/p&gt;" />

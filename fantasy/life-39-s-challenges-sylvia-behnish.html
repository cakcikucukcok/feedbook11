  <title>Life&#39;s Challenges - Sylvia Behnish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lifes Challenges: A Short Story Collection touches on some of the things that many can associate with. Some of the stories are written in a serious vein while others are written with humor. And all are written keeping in mind the unique relationships between people and the diverse situations in which many may find themselves involved.
Lifes Challenges includes twenty-one stories encompassing unique situations, some with a small bit of fact on which the story was built. In My Mothers Fur Coat, Ms. Behnishs mother did actually fall into a ditch in her fur coat; the rest of the story is fiction. A Daughters Guilt is the story of a daughter dealing with an aging parent with dementia. The Young Girl Inside of Me tells the story of an elderly woman, a feeling no doubt felt by many in her age group.
Free Compost, A Vacation with Grandpa, How Not to Eat a Pineapple, A True Appreciation of Nature, A Simple Question as well as Her Mothers Fur Coat are stories based on a humorous look at life.
Sullivan Station is one of the more serious stories. But all the stories in Lifes Challenges will give the reader pause for thought." />

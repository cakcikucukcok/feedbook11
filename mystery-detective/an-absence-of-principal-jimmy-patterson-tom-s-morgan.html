  <title>An Absence of Principal - Jimmy Patterson, Tom S. Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ben Doggett, recent recipient of the School Administrator of the Year award, is a man of high character and morals. Admired by his peers, honored by his superiors, and loved by everyone in Midland, Texas, Ben is a humble family man who always puts others before himself. But with the simple click of a
mouse, all of that is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a message pops up on his MacBook and asks if Ben would like to spin the wheel on an online gaming site, Ben naively hovers his mouse over OK
and clicks. Six weeks later, Ben is thousands of dollars in debt. Prisoner to his newfound gambling addiction and the passionate affections of his secretary, Ben knows his life is taking a fast, steep fall. Unfortunately, every time he thinks he
has found a way out of the madness, the hole he has dug for himself and his family grows deeper. Desperate for a solution, Ben makes another fateful decision that puts not only his life in danger, but also the lives of those who love him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Absence of Principal &lt;/i&gt;is a tale of hope, redemption, forgiveness, and one mans
desperate attempt to return to the life he once lovedbefore it is lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />

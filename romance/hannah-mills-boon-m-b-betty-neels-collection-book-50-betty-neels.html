            &lt;em&gt;Mills &amp; Boon presents the complete Betty Neels collection. Timeless tales of heart-warming romance by one of the world’s best-loved romance authors. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Falling in love wasn’t in the job description.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tiny Paul van Eysink was a very special case to Nurse Hannah Lang, and she had become very fond of his young parents, Corinna and Paul. When they invited her to go back with them to Holland until the baby was completely recovered, Hannah was only too happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The problem was Corinna’s unbending uncle, Doctor Valentijn van Bertes! He could find no fault with Hannah’s nursing skills—but she was only too well aware that she meant little to him as a person. Why should she? He had a very lovely fiancée in Nerissa…&lt;/p&gt;

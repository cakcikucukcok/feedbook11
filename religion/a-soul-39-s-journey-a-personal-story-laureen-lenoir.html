  <title>A Soul&#39;s Journey: a Personal Story - Laureen Lenoir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Souls Journey is indeed a personal story. The journey are lessons that were given to me by my God Presence during the summer of 2013 in answer to the prayer God help me create the life I desire. The Journey is recorded in four books containing twenty four chapters. Most of the time I didnt know where this was going and what I was to do with this information I was being given. The only thing I did know was that the lessons were helping me feel better and my life was changing to reflect more Love, more of God in my life. 
The lessons in the books focus on reaffirming the Truth about each of us and looking to our God Presence to help us make the Truths our Truths which will lead to our living better more satisfying lives. 
What are these Truths? 
That we are where we need to be at this point in our life experience. All that has come before was necessary to make us the person we are today. In other words we are perfect just as we are; 
That we are children of a Loving Infinitely Patient God Presence that is with us always and will help us in all things if we ask; 
That we are worthy of all that is good and pleasing in the entire Universe just because we are sons and daughters of the Universe; 
That our beliefs serve to shape our life experience and if we change our beliefs we can change our world; and 
That we are never alone and we are always surrounded by the Love of God. 
My greatest desire is that these lessons help the readers also come to know God, their God Presence, so that they can also come to know how they can create the life they desire right here on planet Earth." />

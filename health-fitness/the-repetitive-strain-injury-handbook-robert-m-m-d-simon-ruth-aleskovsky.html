  <title>The Repetitive Strain Injury Handbook - Robert M. M.D. Simon, Ruth Aleskovsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A proven recovery plan for the over 8 million sufferers of repetitive strain injury, and a guide for the prevention of future injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a painful, potentially disabling condition that most commonly stems from damage to the upper torso. Long-term misuse or overuse of everyday tools like computers and cash registers results in the painful hands, arms, and neck that are symptomatic of RSI, a condition whose incidence has increased 80 percent in this country since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Repetitive Strain Injury Handbook is a unique, user-friendly guide that is broken into two parts: (1) the 8-step recovery plan and (2) an RSI prevention guide. The 8-step plan moves RSI sufferers beyond the common denial of this ailment and into a diagnosis and treatment plan with a doctor. It provides: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o  Nutrition advice&lt;br&gt;o  An exercise program&lt;br&gt;o  Breathing tips&lt;br&gt;o  Traditional and alternative pain management suggestions &lt;br&gt;o  A holistic maintenance plan for long-term health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second section is filled with suggestions, stories, and tips for RSI sufferers that will help them live pain-free at home, at work, and in their social and intimate lives. There is also a special section of information on women and RSI, since pregnancy, PMS, osteoporosis, mastectomy, and menopause can all aggravate this condition.&lt;/p&gt;" />

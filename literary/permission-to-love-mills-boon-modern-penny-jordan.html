  <title>Permission To Love (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;True love needs no approval Lucas had always urged Lindsay to take charge of her own life, even though it meant defying her father&#39;s wishes. All that changed, however, the day Lucas was left in charge of Lindsay&#39;s inheritance – and her fate. Quite suddenly Lucas withdrew his support and directed Lindsay to marry according to her father&#39;s will. He made it painfully clear that Lindsay could no longer turn to him for warmth and affection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But by the time she&#39;d resigned herself to a future without passion with a man she did not love, Lucas changed his mind again.&lt;/p&gt;

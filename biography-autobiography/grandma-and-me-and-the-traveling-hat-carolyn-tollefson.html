  <title>Grandma and Me and the Traveling Hat - Carolyn Tollefson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on a true story, a beloved grandma and granddaughter, Carol Rose, shared a special bond even though there was a language barrier. Somehow they managed to communicate. 
When Carol Rose turned twelve years old, her grandma sang a little song in Italian about a special hat. After she sang, she brought out a hat box that contained the most beautiful large brim hat that Carol Rose had ever seen. 
Her grandma gave her the hat and told her this hat would bring her happiness. She asked Carol Rose to think of her when she was old enough to wear it. 
Several months later, her precious grandma passed away. Carol Rose loved her grandma so much she felt her heart would break. 
When she was sixteen, she wore the hat to church and immediately thought of her dear grandma. She said a special prayer and asked her grandma to always watch over her. 
As she walked home, a strong gust of wind blew the hat off her head. She ran to catch it, but the wind lifted it high in the air. She asked her grandma to please help her find it. 
Would Carol Rose ever find the hat? 
Grandmas are special to their grandchildren, and even though they are gone, their love keeps them close in our heart." />

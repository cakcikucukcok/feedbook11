  <title>On the Wings of Inspiration - Jeree Wade, Cheryl Metrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;On The Wings of Inspiration: Exploring Our Inner Life through Interpretive Symbols was written in collaboration by two authors: Cheryl Metrick, and Jeree Wade, MA. The book is based on a collection of drawings and poems Cheryl created from spontaneous inspiration where she says, They fell out of my head. These inspirational poems are descriptive of the drawings. The premise of the book is not only to explore the interpretation of the art itself, but to journey into the drawings to find more personal meaning within. The authors lead the readers to take a personal inner journey to self-awareness and inner growth. Cheryl writes interpretations and feelings about each drawing in a narrative, which at times is autobiographical, as she takes her journey through the pictures. Jeree&#39;s commentary and workbook sections delve into symbolism to guide readers through an analytical process to achieve greater awareness, become mindful, and set guidelines in the continued pursuit of a purposeful and fulfilling life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Topics from the metaphysical philosophies to spirituality, humanitarianism, ecology, and energy systems are explored. The workbook sections include a wide range of themes: compassion, intention and focus, manifestation, balance, transformation, maturation, renewal, self-knowledge, self-sabotage, self-awareness, death, letting go, and the meaning of time. A guided process supports the reader to move into a place that is more peaceful and more centered to understand and implement life&#39;s lessons. &lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>Twelve Months of Mystery - Christine E. Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How would you like to read a year&#39;s worth of mystery, one month at a time? This book is filled with stories that both girls and boys will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&#39;s a snowboarding trip to Snow Cliff Lodge in January, where a mint coin set is found under the carpet in a loft closet. Or a missing Valentine card mystery in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, Ivan turns an old vaporizer into his Steaminator and accidentally steams open a small envelope, which does not belong to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Calla will spend a week with her grandmother and wake to a terrible noise in the attic, thunder and lightning. As she slowly climbs the attic stairs, the lights go out! Ahead, two glowing eyes peer back at her! In the August mystery, we wonder what&#39;s behind the fence on Chestnut Drive. Why is it covered in locks? Why are there shadowy lights in the backyard late every night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blake and Jeff are hiding snowballs in their snow cave in preparation for the Carpenter twins&#39; visit during an early November blizzard that has caused a Snow Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will Jenna do when a miniature copy of the shop where she takes her piano lessons lights up suddenly in December? It&#39;s never been wired for electricity! Is there a Christmas mystery brewing?&lt;/p&gt;" />

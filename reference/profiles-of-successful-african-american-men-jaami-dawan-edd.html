  <title>Profiles of Successful African-American Men - Jaami Dawan, EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;On a sunny Saturday morning at Chicago&#39;s Simeon Career Academy back in 2010 at a Concerned Christian Men (CCM) Breakfast I was engaged in a stimulating personal conversation with the late Dr. William Lackland. His insights rocked my world. That conversation eventually inspired me to write a book. This book! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lackland shared some of his university experiences with me. The dean advised him to enroll into several remedial courses including reading and math. The deans attitude conveyed his doubts about Williams ability to pass these courses, much less completing the university curriculum. Dr. Lackland refused to let this stranger deter him from earning his Ph.D., in Chemistry, no less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening to Dr. Lacklands story whet my appetite for other successful African-American mens stories. I had a strong suspicion that African-American men though different in many ways, are very much alike. Most Black men continue to be confronted by seemingly overwhelming odds, but WE persist. This realization motivated me to use our experiences with success to create a directory of African American men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared my directory idea with friends and asked them for help. It was my vision to make it a team project. I got no takers. Thus, I changed the idea from a directory to a book. Over several months I researched and read the literature about successful Black boys and men. I then created an online survey to be completed by a few African American men I know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The survey delved into their childhood, family, employment, profession, and the like. More than fifty men of color were sent the survey by email to complete. Thirteen of them completed the survey. I have worked and learned from time to time with most of these men. Thus, I have had personal experiences with each of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use successful African American mens life experiences as a blueprint for Black boys and young men who are striving to become successful. I want them to realize that the men that they are reading about were once boys just like them.&lt;/div&gt;

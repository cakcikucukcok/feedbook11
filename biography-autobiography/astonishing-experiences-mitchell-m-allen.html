  <title>Astonishing Experiences - Mitchell M. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most adults are familiar with the quote a picture is worth a thousand words, which coincides with the intent of this book to share my astonishing experiences with mostly color pictures.  While writing this book, I enjoyed revisiting some of the pictures you are about to see as you stroll through the ten chapters.
I decided to write each chapter chronologically; however, the document consists of selected noteworthy topics covering my grade school days until the present time.  This document presented an opportunity to share how a Black male moved through local, state, and national systems that discriminated against minorities.  
I recorded my astonishing experiences, from being raised in Clinton Park, to moving to upscale Timber Crest, to serving in the military, to coping with employment, surviving three marriages, and holding membership in four churches.  These experiences provide exceptional peace and joy to my life as well trouble and sorrow as I have lived beyond seventy years old.  Gods grace and mercy carried me to where I am, and with great delight, I present to you my astonishing life experiences." />

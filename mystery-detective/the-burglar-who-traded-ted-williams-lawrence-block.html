  <title>The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams - Lawrence Block</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bernie Rhodenbarr is actually trying to earn an honest living. It&#39;s been an entire year since he&#39;s entered anyone&#39;s abode illegally to  help himself to their valuables. But now an unscrupulous landlord&#39;s threat to increase Bernie&#39;s rent by 1,000% is driving the bookseller and reformed burglar back to a life of crime -- though, in all fairness, it&#39;s a very short trip. And when the cops wrongly accuse him of stealing a priceless collection of baseball cards, Bernie&#39;s stuck with a worthless alibi since he was busy burgling a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; apartment at the time . . . one that happened to contain a dead body locked inside a bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Bernie has a dilemma. He can trade a burglary charge for a murder rap. Or he can shuffle all the cards himself and try to find the joker in the deck -- someone, perhaps, who believes that homicide is the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Great American Pastime.&lt;/p&gt;" />

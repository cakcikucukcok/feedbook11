  <title>Where Is My Happiness? - Nikki Yang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is like an airplane that goes really fast. We are only allowed to go forward; we can never turn back. Time makes us old, and love make us sore. Theres a lot of happiness in our lives, but theres also much sorrow. That is life! That is what makes life so wonderful: happiness sometimes, and sadness other times! Some people might think sadness is not a wonderful thing to keep, and thats true. But if we only had happiness without any sadness, our lives wouldnt be that fun anymore. I know sadness feels really bad. It hurts us a lot. Some people even lose their life because of tears, but everybody has to have some sadness throughout life. We just hope sad times go away faster, and happy moments last longer! Remember, always smile while facing any emotional issues. Itll make life a lot better! Accept the truth, and always trust yourself." />

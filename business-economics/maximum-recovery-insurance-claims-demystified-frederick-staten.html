  <title>Maximum Recovery - Insurance Claims Demystified - Frederick Staten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the profit motive, it is axiomatic that the insurance company will try to pay as little as possible on claims. It will use every legal device that is available in the interpretation and application of its contracts (policies), and from time to time, will stretch the restrictive clauses in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information provided in this book will give the reader the ammunition with which to confront the insurer, corporate entity or wrong doer on a more level playing field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most other books on this subject, this work includes loss procedures under property insurance policies such as homeowners and commercial contracts. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The other drivers insurance company has agreed to pay the cost to repair the collision damage to you new car, but is that all there is. No, you could be entitled to more. The section dealing with automobile property damage will disclose some cash you may have overlooked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You or a resident relative hits an errant shot on the golf course and instead of its intended destination, the ball smashes the windshield of another members car on the parking lot. You are probably not legally liable for the damage, but you can be a good guy and pay the cost to repair under a special coverage in your homeowners policy. Look at all the possibilities in Infrequently Reported Homeowners Claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of a same sex marriage in a state where such unions are recognized, what are your rights with respect to the injuries or wrongful death of a spouse? See chapter (Damages) for a discussion of this question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drunk driver who caused your injuries may not be your only source of restitution. Take a look at Liquor Liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kitchen appliance you have not altered in any way causes a fire that seriously damages your home and injures you or members of your family. What are your rights with respect to claims against the manufacturer or vendor of the product?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you, a friend or relative has been involved in an accident that might have been the fault of another or suffered an insured property loss, this book has the potential to save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars, resulting from underpaid claims or needless expense." />

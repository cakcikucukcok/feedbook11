  <title>People Who Walk In Darkness - Stuart M. Kaminsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a very long absence, Forge is delighted to be bringing back one of Edgar award winning Stuart Kaminsky&#39;s best loved characters, Inspector Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov. Rostnikov is a Russian bear of a man, an honest policeman in a very dishonest post-Soviet Union Russia. Known as &quot;The Washtub,&quot; Rostnikov is one of the most engaging and relevant characters in crime fiction, a sharp and caring policeman as well as the perfect tour guide to a changing (that is, disintegrating) Russia. Surviving pogroms and politburos, he has solved crimes, mostly in spite of the powers that be that rule his world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;People Who Walk in Darkness, &lt;/i&gt;Rostnikov travels to Siberia to investigate a murder at a diamond mine, where he discovers an old secret...and an even older personal problem. His compatriots head to Kiev on a trail of smuggled diamonds and kidnapped guest workers...and what they discover leads them to a vast conspiracy that not only has international repercussions but threatens them on a very personal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;People Who Walk in Darkness&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced novel of modern Russia told by one of mystery&#39;s finest storytellers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

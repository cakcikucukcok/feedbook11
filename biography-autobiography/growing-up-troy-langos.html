      <meta name="description" content="Most of my life I deceived myself by thinking that I was Godly because I was a good kid. And yet, as the apostle John wrote, If we claim fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. I walked in that darkness for quite a while, but my life has been a journey out of that, a journey into the light of Jesus Christ. My parents named me Troy, which means warrior. In a way, this book is about the battles I have faced  physically, emotionally and spiritually. This is the story of my personal growth, and my hope, my sincere prayer, is that it will help you grow, too." />

  <title>Walking Brooklyn - Adrienne Onofri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The guide that shows you the best of Brooklyn.&lt;/b&gt;
Brooklyn is comprised of dozens of vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own distinctive quality and history. But for most people, New York City is synonymous with Manhattan, and until recently few visitors have ventured beyond the famous Brooklyn Bridge to explore the city’s largest borough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Walking Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt;, Adrienne Onofri has created an exceptional guide to and through Brooklyn’s most interesting and notable neighborhoods, providing a mix of information about culture, history, architecture, places to eat, venues to visit, and more. From a walk through the Russian-influenced Brighton Beach, to the expansive Prospect Park, and out to Red Hook, &lt;i&gt;Walking Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt; reveals the many layers and sites of Manhattan’s lesser-known neighbor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fully updated book now comes in color and features notable buildings/sights/attractions that are new, revived or relocated, like Barclays Center, Prospect Park&#39;s Lakeside LeFrak Center, City Point, the Navy Yard, St. Ann&#39;s Warehouse, Brooklyn Bridge Park and other places along the waterfront. In addition, some chapters feature new routes within neighborhoods. The book also has a clear neighborhood map for each walk, photographs, and critical public transportation information for every trip. Route summaries make each walk easy to follow, and a “Points of Interest” section outlines each walk’s highlights. The 30 walks include trivia about architecture, local culture, and borough history, plus tips on where to dine, have a drink, and shop." />

  <title>Transcendentalism - Kurt Kawohl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One needs to keep an open mind and allow the spirit to absorb the logic of who/what God is without being inhibited by what should be considered outdated religious dogma and conditioning that has been a major contributing factor to the causes of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Transcendentalism&lt;/i&gt; can influence the beginning of a new realization in many religions. If humanity would ever accept a completely logical deity called God, Allah, etc., all borders between opposing religious factions would be eliminated and peace thereafter could be a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Most people have their own self attained or learned knowledge or deep religious convictions on spirituality. Many books have been written on various religious beliefs. There are many spiritual people who know that God is the rational Purity who/that does not require servitude, ritualistic prayers or a forced slavery in order for the soul to be a part of Purity for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
ALL religions have the same goal. A Transcendentalist is often a spiritually enlightened individual whose ultimate goal is to unite and strengthen communities or religious organization. God is the enlightenment of ALL who sincerely seek him/it.&lt;/p&gt;" />

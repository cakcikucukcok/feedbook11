  <title>Cassandra Behind Closed Doors - Linda Sorpreso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At thirteen years of age Cassandra Romanelli&#39;s world had turned out to be everything she hated! Cassie lived in a big Italian family with lots of complex relationships. Dealing not only with the rules and regulations of a strict, abusive father, Cassie also struggled with bulimia and had to overcome the taunts and bullying from her classmates, plus peer pressure and a struggle to be accepted. Although pretty, Cassie just saw herself as a chubby Italian girl who was in love with the one guy she couldn&#39;t have - her best friend&#39;s boyfriend. Following physical interference by a family member and betrayal by her best friend, Cassie&#39;s self-esteem plunged to an all time low. The pressures she endured led her to listen to an inner voice that directed her to do a most shameful thing to her body - Purge! In her own mind Cassie felt that she was wise beyond her years. She had seen too much, experienced too many beatings and felt too many bruises, and yet ... Cassie had no idea what was in store for her - her real misfortune was just about to begin! Cassandra Behind Closed Doors, for young people, is a window into real life - and for adults, is an insight into the world of today&#39;s kids with the issues they have to face every day." />

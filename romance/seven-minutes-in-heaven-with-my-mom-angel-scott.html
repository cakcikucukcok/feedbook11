  <title>Seven Minutes In Heaven With My Mom - Angel Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Birthdays can be a blast. For this hot momma, it turns into lots of sexual fun! Come join this tale of mother and son doing a fun game together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s play spin the bottle!&amp;rdquo; Donna shrieked loudly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone else nodded in agreement. Everyone grabbed some mixed drinks and beers from the cooler and the fridge. After that, everyone sat in a big circle in the living room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Birthday girl gets to go first,&amp;rdquo; Donna said as she pointed to Jill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jill spun the bottle. She chuckled as it spun. &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t played this since I was in high school.&amp;rdquo; The bottle landed on her son! Oh shit! Jill thought to herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooh, that makes things interesting. You get to kiss your own son. How sweet.&amp;rdquo; Donna said with a smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Can I kiss him though? In front of everyone?&amp;rdquo; Jill asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep,&amp;rdquo; Jim said with a nod. &amp;ldquo;Keep the game going. It&amp;rsquo;s just a game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jill nodded and moved forward. She got close enough to do a quick kiss on her son&amp;rsquo;s lips. After that, she moved back to her spot. She watched as her son spun the bottle next. Her heart skipped a beat as the bottle spun closer to her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The brown beer bottle pointed to Jill, out of all the ladies in the room. It just had to land on his damn, hot, mom! Damn it! Jack looked up at his mom and then started to turn a little bit of a shade of red in the face. He shrugged his shoulders at Jill and then just looked at the woman sitting next to him and then spoke out to her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re turn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The redhead shook her head and then spoke up. &amp;ldquo;Sorry, Jack. I can&amp;rsquo;t go until you kiss the person it landed on. That&amp;rsquo;s how the game goes. So, go kiss Jill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But, I can&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; Jack protested loudly, still looking bright red in the face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo; The redhead asked curiously as she shrugged her slender shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ummm...because she&amp;rsquo;s my mom, Kim.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So? Do it anyway.&amp;rdquo; Kim said as she made a face at Jack. She shook her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Umm, it&amp;rsquo;s wrong to kiss my mom, Kim. Just spin the damn bottle.&amp;rdquo; Jack said as his voice rose an octave and his voice started to get annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just a game man! Kiss her! So, we can move on!&amp;rdquo; Jim yelled out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone turned to look at Jack as he turned bright red and then looked at his mom who also turned a bright red.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But we..we can&amp;rsquo;t. We&amp;rsquo;re related!&amp;rdquo; Jack exclaimed loudly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone rolled their eyes. &amp;ldquo;So, what? Who the fuck cares. It&amp;rsquo;s just a fucking kiss. Now do it so we can continue!&amp;rdquo; Will chipped into the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jill felt a little freaked out as she watched her friends expect her to kiss her son in front of them. She wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to, even though she already did. Best kiss ever! Jill thought to herself. But she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to kiss her own son, but she does. But to protect her secret, Jill made a disgusted face as she looked at Jack. She wondered what Jack thought about the kiss also and wondered what he would do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack felt disappointed with his mom&amp;rsquo;s face, so he made the same disgusted face back at Jill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, for the love of God, just kiss. It&amp;rsquo;s not that disgusting, and we don&amp;rsquo;t care that you kiss. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the damn game. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get a chance to kiss your own son, then you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here playing this with him.&amp;rdquo;" />

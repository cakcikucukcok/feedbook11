      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This bewitching drama for young adults set in the very near future entwines Celtic myth and climate-changed destinies to answer the fundamental question: can we escape our apparent fate? If our lives are governed by forces outside our control, where can we find hope? When a storm surge destroys Tomos&amp;#39; luxury home and his parents die, and Bryn&amp;#39;s eco-home is torched and his parents killed by starving marauders, these two rivals for the same girl, Eira are forced to rely upon each other for survival in the wild uplands of Wales. One of them will die, but not before they discover the astonishing bond that joins them together. And none of these three teenagers are aware that they are living out an ancient rivalry between fabulous beings - such as Ceridwen, the Welsh Goddess of Inspiration - who are seeking to rewrite the endings of their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />

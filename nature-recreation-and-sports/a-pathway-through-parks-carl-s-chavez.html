  <title>A Pathway Through Parks - Carl S. Chavez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;Bodie, the very sound of that name conjures up images of &quot;The Bad Man From Bodie&quot;, a rough and tumble life, and the harsh climate of a gold mine boomtown of the early West. But to a young park ranger and his wife, fresh out of college, and with a child on the way, it was an intimidating beginning to a 32-year career with California Department of Parks and Recreation.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;A PATHWAY THROUGH PARKS&lt;/B&gt; follows the career of Ranger Carl S. Chavez and his family as they travel the length and breadth of California from the ghost town of Bodie State Historic Park to the mountains and beaches of Southern California. Each new assignment brings new adventures and challenges as Ranger Chavez promotes up the career ladder to positions on the Central Coast of California, the Sierra Nevada and finally to the redwoods of Northern California at Humboldt Redwoods State Park.
&lt;P&gt;Career decisions must be made which result in advancement, &quot;out of the field&quot;, and into the Management ranks of Regional and Division Headquarters. Yet even these changes do not alter the opportunity for stories and tales of humor and tragedy, joy and sorrow, adventure and routine, and the success and failure that many readers will recognize in their own lives. Anyone who has retired from the workforce, regardless of occupation, will have memories like those found in &lt;B&gt;A PATHWAY THROUGH PARKS&lt;/B&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;The author&#39;s experiences will give all those who love the Great Outdoors and enjoy our parks and forests a rare, inside glimpse, not only of the inner workings of park operations, but also, of family life living in parks." />

  <title>The Final Shot - Dan Garth Haskell, David J. Yarbrough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a phenomenal sports story that happened in a town in Utah that most people cant even pronounce; Tooele, tu:illa. It is a true story about a team of destiny that learned about life, compassion, and athletic achievement. It is a real underdog story, a modern day Hoosiers, a shot HERD round the world. It was a miracle.
The message is delivered to us by an underdog comprised of fifteen boys, five assistant coaches, and their head coach. They started out as individuals then worked to become true champions who loved and respected each other. The team was plagued with setbacks and surrounded by an unending array of naysayers and skeptics who defined the impossible. For their head coach it would become a love for his players, his family, his home town, and a battle for life itself." />

Mark was the handsome, arrogant spoiled little rich boy who grew up getting everything he wanted, and it came easy, until Jeanie appeared. She was beautiful, but he was used to the best of everything, so he was not so easily impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeanie had the type of beauty that bordered on hypnotic, plus there was a secret knowledge in her eyes, a magic that sparkled and entranced all those who could see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark could, and he instantly recognized Jeanie for what she was, and not what she &amp;quot;appeared to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark aggressively pursued her, and tried to impress her with his wealth, but Jeanie&amp;#39;s family had money as well, so she was not so easily impressed either. Jeanie could not only match him, but soon Mark was on his guard!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Jeanie unintentionally revealed herself in a way that left Mark stunned, and afterward she was no longer just a conquest; she was his obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark decided that Jeanie was to be his, she would be his wife and the mother of his children, it didn&amp;#39;t matter what she wanted. Mark would do whatever it took to have her, and nothing would stand in his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were other&amp;#39;s equally interested in Jeanie for their own reasons, they were just as selfish, but not as benign. There was a secret sect that Jeanie&amp;#39;s parents worked for and they had decided her fate before she was even conceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her parents were employed by the government, but nobody knew what branch. This sect of the government dealt with the paranormal and knew of Jeanie&amp;#39;s supernatural abilities because that was what she had been bred for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her ancient bloodlines was the reason Jeanie was so valuable to the Government, and even her own parents were expendable if Jeanie could be acquired instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a numerical ritual, Jeanie&amp;#39;s first, last and middle name were each composed of six digits. This 6-6-6,&amp;nbsp; combination identified a specific family lineage. Jeanie. Genealogy. Blood-lines. Jeanie was chosen because of her heritage. And membership was exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jeanie&amp;#39;s was not a girl who would allow her life to be defined by something as arbitrary as a bloodline, and she would not permit herself to be used as a instrument of evil by a secret society, no-matter what they promised; no-matter what they threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jeanie, would not come willing, they would take her by force and initiate her with a hellish ritual that would take control of her mind, body, and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was her soul that they wanted most, because the soul was not just an individual&amp;#39;s eternal identity; it was also pure energy, and now that energy could be trapped and manipulated, with a nightmarish process provided by an alien race, entitled &amp;quot;sheering&amp;quot; which was a type of soul scalping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the soul was trapped in the material world this would make Jeanie a slave, not only in the physical world, but on the spiritual plane as well, and that was eternal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could Mark&amp;#39;s substantial wealth, power, and his penchant for brilliant alternatives in hopeless situations aid in saving Jeanie? Or would Jeanie&amp;#39;s powers in the supernatural be strong enough to protect her, and the ones she loved, from all those who threatened to destroy her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Rath&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Swede - Robert Karjel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Swedish security agent is summoned to interrogate a terror suspect held by the FBI in this sophisticated, fast-paced thriller&amp;#8212;but the prisoner isn&amp;#39;t the only one with something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a remote military base in the Indian Ocean, the FBI is trying to get a prisoner to confess. But the detainee, a suspect in an Islamist-inspired terror attack in the United States, refuses to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernst Grip, a Swedish security officer, has no idea why he&amp;#39;s been dispatched to New York City. The FBI agent he meets on arrival, Shauna Friedman, seems to know a little too much about him. And when he arrives at his real destination, the American authorities have just one question: Is their terror suspect a Swedish citizen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process of uncovering the prisoner&amp;#39;s true identity, Grip discovers the man&amp;#39;s ties to a group of other suspects&amp;#8212;a ruthless American arms dealer, a Czech hit man, a mysterious nurse from Kansas, and a heartbreakingly naive Pakistani. The closer Grip gets to the truth, the more complicated the deception becomes. Who is real and who is leading a double life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Swede&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting, intense novel about the compromises that people&amp;#8212;and nations&amp;#8212;make in the name of security and survival. Within this world built on secrets, Grip and Friedman have to learn to trust each other if they hope to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>OFF THE WALL &amp; On His Pedestal - John King, Laura King, Vaughan King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adventurer, Cartoonist, Innovator, Musician, Man of God, Missionary, Trainer &amp;hellip; all characterize John King. Eagerly accepting challenges that most would say were impossible or couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done, and yet inspiring others to participate with him in his radical &amp;ldquo;Off the Wall&amp;rdquo; endeavours. From jungles with crocodiles, to participating in the Guinness World Records with his musical saw, John wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say NO to any opportunity, sometimes to the dismay of his more sensible wife, Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s motto: &amp;ldquo;Live vibrantly; Learn continuously; Love deeply and Leave a godly Legacy&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;is evident through his life, ministry and relationships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 250 short stories, mostly written from John&amp;rsquo;s creative perspective, we share a slice of humor, a bit of philosophy, a touch of heartache, and some of the lessons we learned through it all. May this book encourage and challenge our family, friends, partners, and all who may choose to read it, as we reveal a few of the experiences God brought into our lives!&lt;/p&gt;" />

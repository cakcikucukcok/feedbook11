  <title>Thorns of a Rose - Logan Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With every picture comes a story to the truth of it. And within every story lies a picture awaiting to be painted. For these poems it goes both ways. The original idea was to write the story of pictures I found online while visiting my girlfriend at the time.  However after writing a few test ones, i began writing a new story based on the feelings I had for her, and with that came a different story that didnt quite fit the pictures. So i stripped the pictures away and decided to let the reader imagine it how they read it, everyone has their own interpretation and none think the same. So within these poems I hope you find interesting stories and memorable paintings your mind envisions." />

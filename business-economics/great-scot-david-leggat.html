  <title>Great Scot - David Leggat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A remarkable record of fifteen trophies in thirteen seasons at Ibrox, plus two with East Fife, should be enough to give any manager legendary status. Especially when the same man became the first manager in Britain to take his club to a European final. Scot Symon did all that and more &amp;amp;#150; and yet he is now an almost forgotten Rangers manager. Scot Symon actually took Rangers to two European finals and had he won one, his place in history would have been assured. Instead, he became Ibrox&amp;amp;#8217;s forgotten man, his contribution woefully neglected. Now, in Great Scot, David Leggat tells the fascinating story of Scot Symon and shows how he helped shape the history of Rangers, managing legendary players such as John Greig, Willie Henderson and the greatest of them all, Jim Baxter &amp;amp;#150; who gave his genius to Symon&amp;amp;#8217;s most outstanding team. And among the biggest names in Scottish football, past and present, who tell their Symon stories, there is a heartfelt tribute to Scot Symon from the last signing he made for Rangers &amp;amp;#150; Sir Alex Ferguson. With such support, Great Scot sets out to show that James Scotland Symon was one of the most remarkable managers Scotland has ever produced and why he now deserves his rightful, prominent place in the history of Rangers and Scottish football.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />

  <title>Shoot the Woman First - Wallace Stroby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A half million dollars in drug proceeds, guarded by three men with automatic weapons. For Wallace Stroby&#39;s determined heroine, professional thief Crissa Stone, and her team, stealing it was the easy part. But when the split goes awry in a blaze of gunfire, Crissa finds herself on the run with a duffel bag of stolen cash, bound by a promise to deliver part of the take to the needy family of one of her slain partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pursuit are the drug kingpin&#39;s lethal lieutenants and a former Detroit cop with his own deadly agenda. They think the money&#39;s there for the taking, for whoever finds her first. But Crissa doesn&#39;t plan to give it up without a fight, even as her mission of mercy puts her and a young child in mortal danger, with forces on both sides of the law closing in. After all, a debt is a debt...even if it has to be paid in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Shoot the Woman First&lt;/i&gt;, Wallace Stroby delivers another powerful, lyrical novel, his third featuring one of the most original female characters in hardboiled fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />

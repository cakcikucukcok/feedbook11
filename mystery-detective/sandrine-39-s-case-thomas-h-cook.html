  <title>Sandrine&#39;s Case - Thomas H. Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Thomas H. Cook offers one of his most compelling novels ever in &lt;I&gt;Sandrine&#39;s Case&lt;/I&gt;, in which a college professor falls in love with his wife all over again...while on trial for her murder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Samuel Madison always wondered what Sandrine saw in him. He was a meek, stuffy doctorate student, and she a brilliant, beautiful, bohemian with limitless talents and imagination. On the surface their relationship and marriage semed perfectly tranquil: jobs at the same small, liberal arts college, a precocious young daughter, a home filled with art and literature, and trips to some of the world&#39;s most beautiful cities and towns. And then one night Sandrine is found dead in their bed and Samuel is accused of her murder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the truth about their often tumultuous relationship comes to light, Samuel must face a town and media convinced of his guilt, a daughter whose faith in her father has been shaken to its core, and astonishing revelations about his wife that make him fall in love with her for a second time. A searing novel about love lost and rediscovered, from one of our greatest chroniclers of the human heart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

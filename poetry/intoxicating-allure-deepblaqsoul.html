  <title>Intoxicating Allure - Deepblaqsoul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perfumed Whispers is my 1st exotic poetry novel. I have been penning poetry for over 34 years and it is with my deepest pleasure I bring you some personal delightful moments. I have given myself the title &quot;SOUL THERAPIST&quot; hoping that this book gives you joy wisdom and laughter and healing. 
Perfumed Whispers is an art of love, passion, elegance and insightful fast paced teasing with a touch of sassy, honey dipped seduction. Some of my most provocative soul travels and steamy allure are depicted in this sexy sensual book and the sizzling masterpieces once absorbed will only open up your appetite for more tasteful interludes. My expressions are addictive, so be aware that some of my displays might be hazardous to your love health and at times you might want to overdose on my personal prescriptions. I am your love doctor, so please take all of your medicine. 
I have had extreme fun writing these pleasurable treasures. Enjoy and look out for my next trail blazer. Do engage yourself in my canvas of soul poetry again and again. 
Thank you for being my audience. The paint only gets better.........." />

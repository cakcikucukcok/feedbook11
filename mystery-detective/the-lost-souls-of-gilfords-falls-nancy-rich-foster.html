  <title>The Lost Souls of Gilfords Falls - Nancy Rich-Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living in the religious commune for the past twelve years has slowly drained seventeen-year-old Mary Snippet of life. She can no longer endure the cruelty of her husband, Zachariah Snippet, and she makes the biggest decision of her young life: she must escape.
Along with her small son and daughter, Mary packs what few belongings they have and flees the commune one chilly evening. She has only a faded photo to guide her back to her real home: a picture of a beautiful white mansion with a few illegible words on the back. 
Relying on the kindness of strangers, Mary struggles to care for her children and fights the terror that, at times, threatens to overwhelm her. When she finds a temporary home in an abandoned cottage, it starts a chain reaction of events that may very well lead her to her lost family. 
But Zachariah Snippet isnt about to let this impudent girl outsmart him, and Mary knows he is hot on her trail. As the net begins to tighten, Mary must draw on all her inner strengthand her faithto survive." />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;* A &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Read the Orphan X series. You&#39;ll thank me later.&quot; --David Baldacci&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling Orphan X returns - just when Evan Smoak thinks he&#39;s done, his deadliest job yet pulls him back Into The Fire...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan Smoak lives by his own code. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once he was known as Orphan X. Trained as an off-the-books government assassin and spoken about only in whispers, Evan Smoak was one of the most talented - and most feared - men in the Program. But he broke free and reinvented himself as The Nowhere Man, a figure shrouded in mystery, known for helping the truly desperate.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone is truly desperate, it&#39;s Max Merriweather. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max is at the end of his rope. His cousin has been brutally murdered, leaving Max an envelope that contains nothing but a mysterious key. However, someone really wants that key, badly enough that Max - and anyone he turns to - is in deadly danger. What seems like a simple job for The Nowhere Man turns out to be anything but. Behind every threat he takes out, a deadlier one emerges and Evan Smoak must put himself in greater danger than ever before as he heads once more Into The Fire.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Selected Poems 1968-2014 - Paul Muldoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The most significant English-Language poet born since the second world war.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Selected Poems 1968-2014&lt;/i&gt; offers forty-six years of work drawn from twelve individual collections by a poet who &quot;began as a prodigy and has gone on to become a virtuoso&quot; (Michael Hofmann). Hailed by Seamus Heaney as &quot;one of the era&#39;s true originals,&quot; Paul Muldoon seems determined to escape definition, yet this volume, compiled by the poet himself, serves as an indispensable introduction to his trademark combination of intellectual hijinks and emotional honesty. Among his many honors are the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the Shakespeare Prize &quot;for contributions from English-speaking Europe to the European inheritance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Among contemporaries, Paul Muldoon, one of the great poets of the past hundred years, who can be everything in his poems--word-playful, lyrical, hilarious, melancholy. And angry. Only Yeats before him could write with such measured fury.&quot; --Roger Rosenblatt, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Islam Folklore Prophet Jesus (Isa) Son of Mary &amp; The Bird from Clay - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the beginning I was clay then I became a bird by Allah&amp;#39;s leave. From motionless clay to a soaring bird. I was something that was not able to move by itself and then I could fly in the sky. That is me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do not know how to introduce myself to history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Allah (Exalted and Glorified be He) introduced me in the last of His Books saying, &amp;quot;(Remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection), &amp;#39;O &amp;#39;Isa (Jesus), son of Mary am (Mary)! Remember My Favor to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibril (Gabriel)) so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you writing, Al-Hikmah (the power of understanding), the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel); and when you made out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My Permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My Permission.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A handful of clay...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was the princess of clay, even though I was made of clay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I fell in love. That was before &amp;#39;Isa the son of Maryam touched me. When I fell in love I began to transform.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How can a creature explain the scent of the earth that was originally the sky?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was calm, still and content with my state of being a lump of clay. I do not dream, for clay does not have the ability to do this. Even though I could not dream, I was content. I had a long history before I became earthly clay. At first, I was a part of the sun. Then billions of years passed by and I had not yet fallen in love, so the burning embers were put out and I was transformed into rock on a planet they call the earth in a place they call Palestine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am a part of the mud of Palestine and a part of its land. Look how much I had suffered. Thousands of years passed by without falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used to drink water, become satisfied and help scented flowers to grow even without enjoying love. It is the instinct of clay to be watered so we can grow flowers. One seed is enough for me to make what amazes both mind and heart. Through all this, I remained as I was, just simple earthly clay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did not see beyond the space taken by my atoms. Clay does not see with eyes for it does not have eyes. Sometimes I see things through a worm or a flower. I do not know what goes on around me; I do not know what happens on top of me. But, sometimes I feel happy and at other times I become sad." />

  <title>Medieval Andhra - Alpana Pandey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book delves into the lives of the Telugus in the 17th and 18th centuries. It highlights the existing social conditions in the region. At the same time it emphasises on certain changes witnessed due to the Muslim rule and the arrival of the traders from European countries. Besides their economic activities, the traders made inroads into the socio - political realm of the region. 
The Qutb-Shahi dynasty, the short Mughal rule under Aurangazeb, and the subsequent Asaf Jahi rule culminated in the establishment of a distinct Hyderabadi Culture, that is famous for religious tolerance and amalgamation of different cultures, and the emergence of Deccani as a language of the people! 
The two new religions, Islam and Christanity, created curiosity, conflicts and conversions in the region. The lack of patrons dealt a blow to the Brahmanical religion. Alternative medicinal system of the Islamic world, Unani was introduced. The Europeans introduced western surgery to the Royalty. The book highlights the emergence of a social order with new castes and sub castes, the change in the social hierarchy, the womens position, social reforms, a new dressing style in the upper section of society and the cosmopolitan luxury in the form of furniture, toiletry, jewelry etc." />

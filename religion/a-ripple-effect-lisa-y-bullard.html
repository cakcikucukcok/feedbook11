  <title>A Ripple Effect - Lisa Y. Bullard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Ripple Effect is an inspirational novel that may challenge your strength to trust or love and test your courage to forgive.
Life is full of surprises when two friends plan to have a spa day. Something goes wrong. Erika, in the emergency room, has memories of her painful past. Everett knows better than to fall for his patient. Especially when his wife isa patient inthe critical care unit. Sharae is confused as she wakes up in the recovery room. Her last memory was driving with her friend Erika. Michael wants to find the right woman. He worries ifa womanwill understand his commitment to raise a son who is not his child.
These people are trying to move beyond their mistakes. Does a hurtful life experience justify the choice to go after what or who they want despite the consequences? The mind may be willing to do the right thing, for a moment, yet the flesh is weak. Life is even more complicated when a truth is revealed that may turn their world upside down." />

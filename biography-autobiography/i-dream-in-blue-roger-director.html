  <title>I Dream in Blue - Roger Director</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Dream in Blue&lt;/em&gt; is television producer Roger Director&#39;s up close and personal chronicle of the 2006-2007 seasons spent with Eli Manning, Plaxico Burress, and the rest of the New York Giants, from the first snap of summer camp to the final touchdown of a tumultuous, heart-stopping journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, Director&#39;s got only one end in mind: the Super Bowl. He guts it out with Big Blue, refusing to let anything sideline him&amp;#8212;not his fumble-prone television career, not even the strain of occasionally having to act like a responsible husband and father. Along the way, he tells the story of this great sports dynasty&#39;s origins and traces its rise to become the heartbeat of New York City and, finally, the world-shocking, Patriots-beating king of pro football. Director was there in Phoenix with his Big Blue heroes as they pulled off the greatest upset in Super Bowl history. In this edition, featuring brand-new chapters that take Giants fans along for the ultimate joy ride, Director continues to dream in blue&amp;#8212;and this time watches his dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;" />

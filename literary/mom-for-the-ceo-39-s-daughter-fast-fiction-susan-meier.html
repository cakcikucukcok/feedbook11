  <title>Mom for the CEO&#39;s Daughter (Fast Fiction) - Susan Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Fiction Romantic - short stories with a Happy Ever After&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When CEO Gabe Fulton invites his assistant to his beach house, Kara Kincaid can&#39;t wait to spend two sun-soaked weeks with her boss. They&#39;re in Charleston to seal a lucrative deal in private, but Kara&#39;s determined to show Gabe a side of herself he&#39;s never noticed at the office: the Kara who favors bikinis over blouses, who&#39;s just as happy building sandcastles with his four-year-old as she is building a business empire. And this Kara is definitely not interested in keeping things professional.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Gabe recently divorced a woman who loved his money more than she ever loved him—or their daughter. Kara can tell those wounds are still fresh. And with a troubled past of her own, she&#39;ll have to work overtime to prove she&#39;s in it for the man, not his billions.&lt;/p&gt;

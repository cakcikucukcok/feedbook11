  <title>Nixon &amp; Rockefeller - Stewart Alsop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;A fascinating analysis of two of the most important figures in 1960s American politics, written during their battle for the GOP presidential nomination.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Richard Milhous Nixon was one of the most controversial politicians in America&amp;rsquo;s history: a California congressman, senator, vice president, and president who was forced to resign his position as US Chief Executive because of his role in the scandalous Watergate affair. Nelson Rockefeller was the scion of a phenomenally wealthy American family and longtime governor of New York State. In 1960 they were the leading contenders to win the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s nomination for president of the United States, one of whom would face the Democratic challenger, Senator John F. Kennedy, in November&amp;rsquo;s general election.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Written by acclaimed journalist Stewart Alsop during the heat of the political race to the Republican Convention, &lt;I&gt;Nixon &amp;amp; Rockefeller &lt;/I&gt;provides a revealing, often surprising dual portrait of two giants of twentieth-century American politics. Alsop, an acknowledged Washington, DC, insider and one of the most esteemed political analysts of his era, explores the backgrounds, mindsets, and distinct personalities, as well as the strengths and failings of these two candidates vying for the highest office in the country.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; The author&amp;rsquo;s intelligent and insightful views on the nature of a Nixon presidency versus a Rockefeller presidency make for fascinating reading in light of the political outcome that ultimately was and one that might have been.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

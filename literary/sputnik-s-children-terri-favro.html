  <title>Sputnik’s Children - Terri Favro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A literary, genre-bending novel full of heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cult comic book creator Debbie Reynolds Biondi has been riding the success of her Cold War era–inspired superhero series, &lt;i&gt;Sputnik Chick: Girl with No Past&lt;/i&gt;, for more than 25 years. But with the comic book losing fans and Debbie struggling to come up with new plotlines for her badass, mutant-killing heroine, she decides to finally tell Sputnik Chick’s origin story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie’s never had to make anything up before and she isn’t starting now. Sputnik Chick is based on Debbie’s own life in an alternate timeline called Atomic Mean Time. As a teenager growing up in Shipman’s Corners — a Rust Belt town voted by &lt;i&gt;Popular Science&lt;/i&gt; magazine as “most likely to be nuked” — she was recruited by a self-proclaimed time traveller to collapse Atomic Mean Time before an all-out nuclear war grotesquely altered humanity. In trying to save the world, Debbie risked obliterating everyone she’d ever loved — as well as her own past — in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so she believes . . . Present-day Debbie is addicted to lorazepam and dirty, wet martinis, making her an unreliable narrator, at best. A time-bending novel that delves into the origin story of the Girl with No Past, &lt;i&gt;Sputnik’s Children&lt;/i&gt; explores what it was like to come of age in the Atomic Age.&lt;/p&gt;" />

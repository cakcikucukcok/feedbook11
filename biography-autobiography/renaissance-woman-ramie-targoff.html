  <title>Renaissance Woman - Ramie Targoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A biography of Vittoria Colonna, confidante of Michelangelo, scion of one of the most powerful families of her era, and a pivotal figure in the Italian Renaissance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramie Targoff&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Renaissance Woman &lt;/i&gt;tells of the most remarkable woman of the Italian Renaissance: Vittoria Colonna, Marchesa of Pescara. Vittoria has long been celebrated by scholars of Michelangelo as the artist&#39;s best friend--the two of them exchanged beautiful letters, poems, and works of art that bear witness to their intimacy--but she also had close ties to Charles V, Pope Clement VII and Pope Paul III, Pietro Bembo, Baldassare Castiglione, Pietro Aretino, Queen Marguerite de Navarre, Reginald Pole, and Isabella d&#39;Este, among others. Vittoria was the scion of an immensely powerful family in Rome during that city&#39;s most explosively creative era. Art and literature flourished, but political and religious life were under terrific strain. Personally involved with nearly every major development of this period--through both her marriage and her own talents--Vittoria was not only a critical political actor and negotiator but also the first woman to publish a book of poems in Italy,  an event that launched a revolution for Italian women&#39;s writing. Vittoria was, in short, at the very heart of what we celebrate when we think about sixteenth-century Italy; through her story the Renaissance comes to life anew.&lt;/p&gt;" />

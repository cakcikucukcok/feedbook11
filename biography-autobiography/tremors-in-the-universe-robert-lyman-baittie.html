  <title>Tremors in the Universe - Robert Lyman Baittie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its funny how life has a way of changing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely changed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tooling along day after day, set in my ways, looking at life like a racehorse wearing blinders, oblivious to seeing the world any other way than I knew how, because I ultimately had fashioned my vision of it. I fit myself with the glasses I wore, and I wrote the prescription for the lenses with my attitude, faith, and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got lucky. Parkinsons came along, slapped me upside the head, and knocked my spectacles off of my face. And luckier still, while my glasses were on the ground I inadvertently stepped on them and crushed them into a million pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was forced to extend my hands out in front of me to rediscover my world all over again. Taking baby steps with fear in my heart that I would bang my head into a wall. But you know what happened? A miraculous thing took place. My memory of where the important things in my life were took over, and what I valued and needed the most magically appeared for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, friendship, compassion, spirit and purpose. My appreciation for what was at my fingertips was heightened as well. I suddenly discovered a comforting realization that I could continue to succeed in life with less. Less envy, less anger, less anxiety, less fear of old age and death. It was liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was given Parkinsons disease, and my life became better for it.&lt;br /&gt;
This book is not what most people have come to expect about Parkinsons disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tremors in the Universe offers another way. Another way of thinking. Another way of living.&lt;/p&gt;" />

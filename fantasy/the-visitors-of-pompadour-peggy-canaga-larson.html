  <title>The Visitors of Pompadour - Peggy Canaga Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pompadour is the name of a two-thumbs-tall wingless dragon. She lives across a moor, beside a brooklet, and has a beautiful view of the sea. She has a secret wish, which is revealed when four season fairies come to her one wintry night as she sleeps in her comfy chair beside the fire. They bring with them a gift from the one who makes the flowers grow. So someone was paying attention as she went about her daily tasks of gathering food and sharing it, keeping house, and hanging the laundry. She is friends with the birds and the bugs and even the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the book written in a rhyming cadence, one reader described it as a cross between Dr. Seuss and J. R. R. Tolkien. A read-aloud book, this is a favorite for children and adults alike, teaching that though we go through our daily tasks and service, we are being watched by someone.&lt;/p&gt;" />

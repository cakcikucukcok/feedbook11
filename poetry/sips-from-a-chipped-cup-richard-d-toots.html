  <title>Sips from a Chipped Cup - Richard D. Toots</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How can you capture a heart and commit it to a page? Sips from a Chipped Cup: A Pilgrims Love presents an inspiring collection of poems written by Richard Toots and filled with the inspiration and emotion that accompanies his walk with Jesus Christ. In the almost forty years that Toots has walked with his Lord Jesus Christ, he has found that, though he falls often, Jesus Christ is always faithful. Through his verse, he endeavours to show the loving kindness to others that Jesus Christ has shown to him and to share his wonderful relationship with Jesus Christ with others. In his poems, from Jesus Loves More to All My Rainbows, he explores his love for Jesus Christ and marvels at the beauty and forgiveness he infuses into our lives every day. 
Take a few minutes to sit back, raise this chipped cup, and enjoy the heartfelt poetry from Sips from a Chipped Cup: A Pilgrims Love.
Walk the Path
Walk the well-worn path
Lit by prayer
And by Gods word
Set aflame.
Witness the Gospel
Of your dear Lord
O, child
Love the name." />

  <title>Crossing Over - Ruth Irene Garrett, Rick Farrant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A work &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; called &amp;#2863;ving and life&amp;#8211;affirming, Crossing Over is the true story of one woman&amp;#39;s extraordinary flight from the protected world of the Amish people to the chaos of contemporary life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruth Irene Garrett was the fifth of seven children raised in Kalona, Iowa, as a member of a strict Old Order Amish community. She was brought up in a world filled with rigid rules and intense secrecy, in an environment where the dress, buggies, codes of conduct, and way of life differed even from other Amish societies only 100 miles away. This Old Order community actively avoided all interaction with &amp;#3304;e English&amp;#2012;&amp;#39;96 everyone who lived on the outside. As a result, Ruth knew only one way of life, and one way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compelling narrative takes us inside a hidden community, offering a striking look as one woman comes to terms with her discontent and ultimately leaves her family, faith and the sheltered world of her childhood. Unsatisfied, she bravely crosses over to contemporary life to fully explore the foreign and frightening reality in hope of better understanding her emotional and spiritual desires. What emerges is a powerful tale of one woman&amp;#39;s search for meaning and the extraordinary lessons she learns along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

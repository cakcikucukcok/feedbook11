  <title>When Everything Get&#39;s in the Way - Mattia M. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It began with the heartbreaking unparalleled bond between family and lovers trust.
An Emotional, provocative, spiritual and unforgettable novel about how we love, how we long to be loved, how the choices we make from day to day has cause and effect in our everyday lives.
This novel is broad in scope and settings. Wise, and dramatically true in its story telling. When Everything Gets In The Way is a completely captivating novel that foretells deeply felt pains of betrayal, lies, deceit and the broken bonds of trust by a loved one and what it means to be human and to love and wanting to be loved.
What happens to them and the large and small manners, in which it echoes throughout, the lives of so many other people is proof of the moral complexity of life, which involves lovers wounds, and betrayal. And the honor and sacrifice we make for one another to get to the top." />

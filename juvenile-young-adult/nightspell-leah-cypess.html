  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Nightspell - Leah Cypess</i></b> | Author Leah Cypess - Young Adult Novel titled Nightspell will be released February, 2011.<br /><b><i>Nightspell - Author Leah Cypess</i></b> | Nightspell by Leah Cypess is a companion novel to her debut, Mistwood. It can be read as a stand alone novel, the two only share one character and you don't need to know her story from the first novel to enjoy or understand this one. Despite what the synopsis may lead you to believe, Darri is really not the main character.<br /><b><i>Nightspell (Mistwood, #2) by Leah Cypess</i></b> | NIGHTSPELL is a ghost story rich with betrayal, royalty, murder, magic, politics and nonstop suspense. Definitely a page turner that is hard to put down. Leah Cypress vividly introduces the reader to Ghostland, which is quite literally a spooky kingdom.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Nightspell - Leah Cypess</a> </h3></p><hr/>

  <title>Life Can Be Positively Different - Virginia Colin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Life Can Be Positively Different&lt;/b&gt; is a friendly and practical guide to happiness that approaches you in an gentle and, yes, positive way. It  invites you to look at your current situation and evaluate your relationships. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Life Can Be Positively Different&lt;/b&gt; looks at how you can lead a more fulfilling life by adopting a more positive approach to your relationships and to your life. It focuses mostly on how you can change your perception and your attitudes to feel happier and more serene.
From her professional experience as a counsellor, the author of this book has found that in life-Acceptance, appreciation, and support are the keys that open up the door to happier relationships. Once you know how to apply them, your life becomes positively different.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Life Can Be Positively Different&lt;/b&gt; is written in a clear, concise, and conversational style which makes it easy to read and apply. It communicates genuine care and support from someone who has experienced the ups and downs of relationships in her professional and personal lives.
&lt;p&gt;
The book acknowledges that although you cannot always change the circumstances in your life, you do have a choice on how you react to them.  A positive mental outlook, open-mindedness,  flexibility, and gratitude are some of the attitudes that can help you increase the positives in your life and decrease the negatives.
&lt;p&gt;
The three principle ideas of accepting, appreciating, and supporting other people are deceptively simple ones. We all know we should do these things, but actually achieving them in real life situations is not so easy.
&lt;p&gt;
The author guides you  gently towards achieving these qualities by reviewing the choices and relationships in your life, and finding new ways to respond to the world around you. You will be surprised at how your life can improve when you begin to look at it in a new way." />

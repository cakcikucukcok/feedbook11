  <title>Jesus, the Christ - Thomas Sutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt; I was raised in a Christian home. I loved hearing stories about Jesus and his life here on earth. Growing up, I became less and less enthusiastic about my religion for several reasons. One critical reason was a natural process. As I matured, I became more aware of the hypocrisy of religion. You know -- Do as I say, not as I do. One day a week act like a Christian, and the other six days be selfish, greedy, and a bigot. At that time, my faith wasn&#39;t strong enough to endure. Now I know that if I look hard enough, I can find hypocrisy in anything. I pray that I&#39;ve grown beyond the paradox. &lt;P&gt;
My book is an attempt to make the first four books of the New Testament easy to read. It&#39;s written in prose. In other words, it&#39;s a narrative of Jesus&#39; life using the first four Gospels. My book combines Matthew, Mark, Luke and John into a chronological narrative of Jesus&#39; life. It is written through the eyes of &#39;you,&#39; as Peter. &lt;P&gt;
The book is Scriptural. It doesn&#39;t change, alter, or sensationalize the original versions of events. In some instances, I combine multiple versions of the same event into one. My inspiration for writing this book is to bring enthusiasm about Jesus to Christians and new revelations to non-Christians. &lt;P&gt;

  <title>A Trace of Deceit - Karen Odden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;A Dangerous Duet&lt;/em&gt; comes the next book in her Victorian mystery series, this time following a daring female painter and the Scotland Yard detective who is investigating her brother&amp;#8217;s suspicious death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;A young painter digs beneath the veneer of Victorian London&amp;#8217;s art world to learn the truth behind her brother&amp;#8217;s murder... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwin is dead. That&amp;#8217;s what Inspector Matthew Hallam of Scotland Yard tells Annabel Rowe when she discovers him searching her brother&amp;#8217;s flat for clues. While the news is shocking, Annabel can&amp;#8217;t say it&amp;#8217;s wholly unexpected, given Edwin&amp;#8217;s past as a dissolute risk-taker and art forger, although he swore he&amp;#8217;d reformed. After years spent blaming his reckless behavior for their parents&amp;#8217; deaths, Annabel is now faced with the question of who murdered him&amp;#8212;because Edwin&amp;#8217;s death was both violent and deliberate. A valuable French painting he&amp;#8217;d been restoring for an auction house is missing from his studio: find the painting, find the murderer. But the owner of the artwork claims it was destroyed in a warehouse fire years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a painter at the prestigious Slade School of Art and as Edwin&amp;#8217;s closest relative, Annabel makes the case that she is crucial to Matthew&amp;#8217;s investigation. But in their search for the painting, Matthew and Annabel trace a path of deceit and viciousness that reaches far beyond the elegant rooms of the auction house, into an underworld of politics, corruption, and secrets someone will kill to keep.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&amp;#160;" />

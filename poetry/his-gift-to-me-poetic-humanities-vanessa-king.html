  <title>His Gift to Me: Poetic Humanities - Vanessa King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;His Gift to Me: Poetic Humanities&lt;/i&gt; is a short read, but impacting. It is an
awe-inspired collection of tell-all poems about his story, her story, my story, and
even, your story in a poetic voice. It is the voice of the inhibited and the proud,
the introvert and the extrovert. It is open, honest, and compassionate poetry that
soothes as it communicates hurt, heartache, pain, love, joy, peace, and happiness. Its
life in a poetic voice. &lt;i&gt;His Gift to Me: Poetic Humanities&lt;/i&gt; strengthens and embraces
the reader as it acts as a help aid in moving on and living whole.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
Ms. Kings book, &lt;i&gt;His Gift to Me: Poetic Humanities, is inspiring and lifted my soul.&lt;br&gt;
Bridgett Anne Kotz, Chicago, Illinois
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Kings words of wisdom, encouragement, and experience . . . just as Dr. King,
We shall overcome.&lt;br&gt;
Ayonda W., Chicago, Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Kings &lt;i&gt;His Gift to Me&lt;/i&gt; is a raw and emotional journey. This journey through the
roller coaster that is life is filled with such realism that anyone can relate to. It is a
true testament that if God brought you to it, he will bring you through it.&lt;br&gt;
Catherine Goodwin, Lansing, Illinois
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The poem Why touched me because it felt like it related to me, now, that I am
overcoming pain and hurt. It was a joy to see the words on paper. Overall, this poetry
book was uplifting to my soul; it touched my heart and is full of wisdom.&lt;br&gt;
Sherry Nesbury, Chicago, Illinois
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;His Gift to Me&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary life-lived book of poems. It gets two thumbs up
and a You go girl! in Jesuss name.&lt;br&gt;
Robin Jones, Chicago, Illinois
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Life allowed you the opportunity to live it once more; a chance to rearrange your
life or to continue as before. Thats the part which stood out for me. I have another
chance to live again.&lt;br&gt;
Mary Walker, Chicago, Illinois
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book &lt;i&gt;His Gift to Me&lt;/i&gt; is an interesting read. It pulls the reader into its pages and
transports them to live, for a short while, within its storyline and message. You dont
have to have any religious beliefs to understand the message that comes acrossthe
message being of hope and of the power of the human mind.
Ive given this book to others to read; theyve had positive and similar experiences
as well. The verbiage is in a certain style, which helps to place the reader in the
appropriate mind frame lending to the credibility.&lt;br&gt;

  <title>You Talk, I’Ll Listen - Nancy Brinkley Weems</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So often people pray and wonder if their prayers, or even thoughts, have been lost to the atmosphere. Nancy Brinkley Weems came to a relationship with Christ as an adult with many questions. Not wanting mans answers, she sought out Gods voice. When a friend read a God conversation, she was taken aback that someone would freely chat with God and hear from Him directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In You Talk, Ill Listen, Nancy Brinkley Weems will use her teaching skills and knack for bringing new information in at a level that anyone can grasp. Sharing her battles of spiritual growth through growing up, and growing old; chatting with God about the trials in life, including losing her husband of thirty-eight years, and hearing Gods voice are some of the themes of this book. God spoke us into existence and is still speaking to us now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say I was amazed with this book. I found it amazing that you so honestly bared the truth of your soul and your relationship with God, so that others could find theirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Lowe, New Smyrna Beach, Florida &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses you to speak to others, and he is allowing that to happen in a very meaningful way. Your words, which I believe are inspired by God, have provided insight and comfort during a tragic time in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Expert Golfer - Matthew Cooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This golf book is second to none when it comes to educating both golfers and golf coaches on the various aspects of practice that enables the highest level of golf performance. There is a science when it comes to learning, and this golf book attempts to break it down into a pleasant read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning about golf most writings are based solely on mechanics, whereas this golf book goes to the cause, not the effect of all golfers problems - practice. Practice is the number one reason golfers stifle their skill development, and the overall goal of this golf book is change that. Golfers focus far too much on bashing golf balls rather than hitting golf shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert Golfer is one of few golf book to compile evidence based coaching strategies that have been used out in the field. Whether you are a golf professional giving golf lessons on the driving range, or you are an avid golfer looking to get better and shave a few strokes off your game, this golf book is what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motor learning, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience are domains that this golf book shares in a practical way. Some of the latest in elite performance research is broken down in a way that is much easier to read, whilst still upholding a scholarly vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll learn about:&lt;/p&gt;
	Group and individual training
	Varying the conditions for greater learning
	Interleaving and blocking practice sessions
	The effects of spacing and distributing during practice
&lt;p&gt;And a lot more! These are just some of the items discussed in this golf book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best golfers in the world seem to leave their spectators in awe. Their high level of motor skill when executing fine movements in a game that breeds more frustration than inspiration makes it difficult to comprehend. The complexity of golf&#39;s main aim (getting the little white ball in the hole and bypassing the obstacles presented around it) caused mathematicians to conclude that without proper practice and form, this goal is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do they do it? What makes them so special? Why are they so good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will guide you through scientific principles that reveal how the best became the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Expert Golfer has been written and designed as a book, it does possess characteristics of a golf manual, due to its nature of high level information. Learning scientists have spent their lives trying to understand what makes elite performers elite, and what makes the best better than the rest. It is now time to use what they have found, and apply it to our industries coaching. Call it a golf manual if you please, the content is what differentiates this book, from any other you have ever read.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Luke Stone Thriller: Situation Room (#3) and Oppose Any Foe (#4) - Jack Mars</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bundle of books #3 (SITUATION ROOM) and #4 (OPPOSE ANY FOE) in Jack Mars&#39;s Luke Stone Thriller series-a #1 bestseller with over 400 five star reviews! This bundle offers books three and four in one convenient file, with over 150,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SITUATION ROOM (Book #3) a cyberattack on an obscure U.S. dam leaves thousands dead and the government wondering who attacked it, and why. When they realize it is just the tip of the iceberg-and that the safety of all of America is at stake-the President has no choice but to call in Luke Stone. Head of an elite, disbanded FBI team, Luke does not want the job. But with new enemies-foreign and domestic-closing in on her from all sides, the President can only trust him. What follows is an action-packed international roller-coaster, as Luke learns that the terrorists are more sophisticated than anyone realizes, that the target is more extensive than anyone could image-and that there is very little time left to save America.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OPPOSE ANY FOE (Book #4) a small arsenal of U.S. nuclear weapons are stolen from a NATO base in Europe. The world scrambles to figure out who the culprits are and what their target is-and to stop them before they unleash hell on humanity. With only hours left before it is too late, the President has no choice but to call in Luke Stone, the former head of an elite FBI para-military team. Finally getting his life back in order, and with devastating news on his own family front, Luke does not want the job. But with the newly elected female President desperate for his help, he realizes he cannot turn his back on her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political thrillers with non-stop action, dramatic international settings, unexpected twists and heart-pounding suspense, the Luke Stone series is an explosive new series that will leave you turning pages late into the night. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #5 in the series will be available soon." />

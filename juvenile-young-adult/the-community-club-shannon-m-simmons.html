  <title>The Community Club - Shannon M. Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cynthia Hale is a true cancer survivor. With help from her friends and family, she was able to beat the horrible disease. After eighteen
months with leukemia, shes finally ready to lead a normal life again. &lt;p&gt;
The CC, or Community Club, are happy to welcome Cynthia into their club. She soon feels right at home.&lt;p&gt;
But its summer, and many of the clubs siblings and baby-sitting charges are starting to feel that dreaded boredom that comes with summertime. The CC is ready to help, so they plan the perfect way to keep kids busy - a day camp! With so many kids and so much sun,
the girls feel sure that they can raise a lot of money to send to the local wildlife reserve.&lt;p&gt;
As soon as camp starts, however, the girls face challenges. Four children is hard enough, but with more than twenty children to look after and only two extra pairs of hands, the girls are afraid that instead of helping the neighborhood kids they might just be setting them up to get themselves into trouble. And what about the helpless animals that are counting on them?" />

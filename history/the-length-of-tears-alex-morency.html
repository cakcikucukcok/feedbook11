  <title>The Length of Tears - Alex Morency</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Anthony Moore is born in Haiti in 1979, he finds himself at a disadvantage to even his own twin, who everyone thinks is cuter because of his lighter skin.
Things dont get any better; little Tonys mother dies when hes two years old. Shortly after, Tonys twin dies, and people begin to whisper that maybe hes somehow to blame. 
In a culture dominated by voodoo, people think little Tony could have used supernatural powers to kill his own twin out of jealousy. When Tonys father remarries, his stepmother treats him like an outsider and an outcast. Shedding tears becomes a regular part of life.
Things seem to take a turn for the better when Tony moves to the United States with his father, but he must still contend with his evil stepmother as well as the competing messages he gets from Christianity and voodoo traditions.
Join Tony as he comes of age and seeks to overcome abuse, confusion and cultural differences so he can move beyond &lt;i&gt;The Length of Tears.&lt;/i&gt;" />

  <title>Northwood - Maryse Meijer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;A sharp-edged modern fairy tale that reimagines a torrid romance as a kind of mythical monster story 
&lt;li&gt;A gorgeously designed literary object, &lt;i&gt;Northwood&lt;/i&gt; is also a poetic novel-in-fragments; the book is packaged with a striking cover, interior black paper with white text, intermittent original illustrations, and an experimental layout; the design deepens the reader&#39;s immersion into darkening hours of the woodsy winter setting, and into the narrator&#39;s violent romantic relationship&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the spirit of Anne Carson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Autobiography of Red&lt;/i&gt; comes the unforgettable new book by the author of the story collection &lt;i&gt;Heartbreaker&lt;/i&gt;, which was named an Electric Literature Best Short Story Collection of 2016 and a &lt;i&gt;Chicago Review of Books&lt;/i&gt; Best Fiction of 2016&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haunting the fringes of the narrator&#39;s consciousness and her story are fragments of her father&#39;s suicide, her mother&#39;s well-meaning criticisms, and her own struggles as a visual artist
&lt;li&gt;Meijer began writing the book during her Yaddo residency, following a series of personal losses. Interested in poetic and microfiction forms as a way to play with narrative and structure, and influenced by the woods and wildlife surrounding Yaddo, &lt;i&gt;Northwood&lt;/i&gt; was born out of an experimentation with form as a response to grief and wildness" />

  <title>Mutiny on the Bounty - Captain William Bligh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Bligh (1754-1817) was an officer of the British Royal Navy and a colonial administrator eventually rising in rank to Vice Admiral. During his command of the &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1789, a notorious mutiny occurred. William Bligh and eighteen of his loyal seamen were expelled from the &quot;Bounty&quot; onto a small boat and began the greatest open-boat voyage in history, sailing some 4,000 miles to protection in Timor. The mutineers, led by Fletcher Christian, sailed off with the &quot;Bounty&quot; in other pursuits. &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; is a collection of early detailed documents of the voyage of the &quot;Bounty&quot;. Largely in part to the effort of Bligh to maintain an accurate log before, during, and after the actual mutiny, even the Bounty&#39;s crew list is well chronicled. Bligh returned to Britain and reported the mutiny to the Admiralty two years and two and a half months after leaving England." />

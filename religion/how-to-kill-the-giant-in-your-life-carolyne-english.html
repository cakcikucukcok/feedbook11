  <title>How to Kill the Giant in Your Life - Carolyne English</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was  led to write, &quot;How to Kill The Giant In Your Life,&quot; because God know that our life is like that of David, facing the giant, (the enemy in our daily walk.  We are heirs in the Kingdom of God, because we are His children.  God has given us authority, but we refuse to use it, yet we pray for things or situations that God has given us the authority to handle or change ourselves.  We live by faith and not by sight. 
If we have the faith to believe and move our faith out of &quot;Neutral&quot; and put it in &quot;Drive,&quot; we can have the same victory God gave David.
In Isaiah 54:17, &quot;No weapon formed against you shall prosper and every tongue which rises against you in judgement, &quot;you shall condemn.&quot;  Did God say he will condemn or you shall condemn.  Matthew 18:17, &quot;Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&quot;  Did God say, He will bind or loose or did He say whatever you bind or you loose?
I think being a Teacher is one of the greatest gifts of all.   In order to understand God, we first must know who God is and in order to know who God is, we first must take the time to study the Word.  The Book of Genesis teaches about God&#39;s Royalty Family, His Creation &amp; His Kindgom.  We pray a simple prayer, because God deals with the heart and God still hear our prayers.  We can pray with a sincere heart and cry out to God and He still rescues us and answers us. Jeremiah 33:3, &quot;Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.&quot;
As we grow spiritually, our prayer life changes the same way as we mature in our walk with Christ.  We drank milk as babes and when the times comes, we are no longer drinking milk, but we began to eat meat. This is the same process for our spiritual growth, because we are no longer babes in Christ.  When we become mature Christians, we began to pray scriptural prayers, which are more effective, but we have to abide in the Word of God.  Sometimes we have to wait on our prayers to be answered, because God is a timely God.  He is eternal and our time is not His time. Sometimes God moves swiftly and He hears the cry of the righteous.  James 5:16, &quot;The effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.&quot;
I remembered when I first come to Christ, I did not understand some of the Biblical terminology of the Word, or it&#39;s meaning, and I knew there was a lot to learn.  Yet, in my learning there were times I became frustrated, because I did not understand the Bible. The course, English during my adolescent years in school seem to be the hardest Language to learn, because of conjunctions, pronouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives and when I stated reading the Bible, I thought, &quot;Oh my God, how do you pronounce the names and what do these parables mean?&quot;  I found out that if you ask God for understanding of His Word, He will give you understanding, because it is His will for us to know the will of God and not to walk in ignorance of His Word. 
This book is about learning how to fight the enemy, how to use God&#39;s weapon and knowing the weapons of God.  It is also about learning as you grow spiritually.  2 Corinthians 10:4, &quot;For the weapons (God&#39;s Word) of our warfare (war against the enemy -satan) are not carnal (worldly or earthly), but mightly through the pulling down of strongholds (strong defensive structure of protection).  We are fighting against things that cannot be seen by the naked or natural eyes.  Have you ever seen someone who, &quot;Out of the blues&quot; (happened suddenly), attack you mentally or physically and there was actually, no logical reason for this strange behavior?  Well, it was not the person in the natural that attacked you, but the enemy that used this person.  Read 2 Corinthians 10:4 again to find out who the enemy is.  This is what needs to be taught in churches so that Christians can become Prayer Warriors.
I pray that this book will inspire those who are seeking God to learn and know th" />

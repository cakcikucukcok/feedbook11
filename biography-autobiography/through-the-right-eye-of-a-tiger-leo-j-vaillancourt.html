  <title>Through the Right Eye of a Tiger - Leo J. Vaillancourt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about Leo J Vaillancourt tour of duty during the Korean War 1950  1951. He enlisted into the U.S. Army September 1948, completing 20 years of service, retiring from the U.S. Army June 1969.
As a tank gunner on a M46 Tank, much of the story is what was observed thru a gunners periscope and the 6 power telescopic sight used for sighting the 90mm gun. (The right eye of a tiger,) is explained in the story. All of the events in this story took place before I was 21 years of age, and had an influence on me the remainder of my life. This is by no means the only event that took place while I was in Korea, but only what I can recall, after more than 60 years have passed, I own my life to the Offices and NCOs of my unit. We completed all assigned missions and they kept unit casualty down, do to their knowledge and leadership. Most of them had WW2 experience." />

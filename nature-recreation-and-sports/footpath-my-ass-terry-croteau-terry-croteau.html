  <title>Footpath My Ass! - Terry Croteau, Terry Croteau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Terry Croteau was twelve years old, tromping around the woods on family outings, looking under leaves for frogs and salamanders, and relieving herself behind trees, she had no idea shed end up spending over half year doing the same thing from Georgia to Maine. . . in her fifties! 
What causes a midlife baby boomer to leave her job, sell the house, farm out the furniture and cram all the leftovers in a ten by ten foot storage unit and carry thirty-five plus pounds on her back over 2174 miles?  Well, your guess is as good as mine, but thats what she did. 
Join  Terry, (trail name Bluebird) as she prepares, then walks, crawls, trips, and falls her way up the Appalachian Trail, (AT) from Springer Mountain, GA to Baxter Parks Katahdin, in ME.  Allow yourself the experience of hiking the AT by living vicariously through Bluebirds journal entries and reflections.  Experience the routine and the totally unexpected, in the life of a long distance thru hiker.  Learn where a good sense of humor, sweat, tears and a Dont give up! attitude might take you.  Realize how success can be measured more keenly by your attitude than by your accomplishments, that believing in you is half the battle, the other half is putting one foot in front of the other. 
According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, approximately 1,150 northbound thru hikers began their trek in 2006 (GA to ME) of the 1,150 hikers, 659 individuals, a little over half, made it to Harpers Ferry, W.Va. (Bluebird was number 501) Maines Katahdin greeted 30% of the original 1,150 hikers, with a total of 349 completions in 2006.  You will connect with some of those people in Terrys journal.
It doesnt matter if youre young, old, male or female, you will appreciate what you find between the cover pages of this book.  The author reminds us that, Life isnt over till your six foot under and if youre on this side of the dirt and breathing, youre alive! So, for God sake and your own, live!" />

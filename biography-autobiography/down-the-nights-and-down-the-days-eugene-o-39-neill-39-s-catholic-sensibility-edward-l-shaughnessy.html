  <title>Down the Nights and Down the Days: Eugene O&#39;Neill&#39;s Catholic Sensibility - Edward L. Shaughnessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This latest book from veteran O&#39;Neillian Edward L. Shaughnessy examines the influence of the Irish playwright&#39;s Catholic heritage on his moral imagination.  Critics, due to O&#39;Neill&#39;s early renunciation of faith at age 15, have mostly overlooked this presence in his work.  While Shaughnessy makes no attempt to reclaim him for Catholicism, he uncovers evidence that O&#39;Neill retained the imprint of his Irish Catholic upbringing and acculturation in his work.     Shaughnessy discusses several key plays from the O&#39;Neill cannon, such as Long Day&#39;s Journey into Night, The Iceman Cometh, and Mourning Becomes Electra, as well as the lesser-known Ile and Days Without End.     Winner of the Irish in America Manuscript competition, Down the Days and Down the Nights: Eugene O&#39;Neill&#39;s Catholic Sensibility is a compelling investigation into the psyche of one of the most brilliant, internationally honored playwrights of our time." />

  <title>The Golden Bough (Abridged) - Sir James George Frazer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sir James George Frazer developed an affinity for classic literature at a young age, which developed into a very real talent through his schooling at Glasgow University and then Trinity College at Cambridge, where he remained as a Classics Fellow for all but one year of his life. After the success of his first novel, &quot;Totemism&quot;, in 1887, Frazer set out to create what was to become his defining work, &quot;The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion&quot;. Originally a two-volume edition, the work expanded into multiple volumes, which in 1922 he edited down to the most widely-read abridged version, which has been reproduced here for this edition. It was initially celebrated as a remarkable study of comparative anthropology, but was later discredited by scientists because Frazer did not follow standard scientific procedures. Nevertheless, it could not be denied the work was an incredible literary accomplishment, influential towards the development of Western thought and such great 20th century thinkers as Freud, Anatole France, Margaret Mead, and Oswald Spengler." />

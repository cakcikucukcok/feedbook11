  <title>THE TALE OF THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN - The Tales of Peter Rabbit Book 07 - Beatrix Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan&lt;/b&gt; is a children&amp;#39;s story written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter. The story tells of a cat called Ribby and a tea party she holds for a dog called Duchess. Complications arise when Duchess tries to replace Ribby&amp;#39;s mouse pie with her own veal and ham pie, and then believes she has swallowed a small tin pastry form called a patty-pan. Its themes are etiquette and social relations in a small town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter&amp;#39;s Hill Top farm, and have been described as some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter&amp;#39;s neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter&amp;#39;s cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences inspired Potter&amp;rsquo;s imagination and enhance the tale&amp;#39;s timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life.&lt;br /&gt;

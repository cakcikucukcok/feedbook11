  <title>100 Things Every Black Girl Should Know: for girls 10-100 - Taura Stinson, Adah Glenn, Stacey Debono</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;100 Things Every Black Girl Should Know is the quintessential collection of invaluable advice designed specifically for you, the young black girl trying to navigate her way through life, as well-seasoned woman looking to brush up on the essentials. This lighthearted but serious gem of a book has made an impact on various races (in testing), but the author wrote it from her perspective as a black woman who was once a young girl who wishes she knew then what she knows now. Since that isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, she has compiled some of her best and hardest lessons into ten chapters that each include ten &amp;ldquo;things you should know&amp;rdquo;, ranging from oral care to the inevitability of heartbreak. This book is intended to spark conversations and change the narrative between sister-friends, mothers and daughters, and womankind, alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit www.

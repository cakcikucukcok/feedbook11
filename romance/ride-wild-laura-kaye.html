  <title>Ride Wild - Laura Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 2017 RT Reviewers&#39; Choice Award Nominee for Best Romantic Suspense!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the Washington Post&#39;s Best Romance Novels of November!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brotherhood. Club. Family.&lt;br/&gt;They live and ride by their own rules.&lt;br/&gt;These are the Raven Riders... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild with grief over the death of his wife, Sam &amp;#8220;Slider&amp;#8221; Evans merely lives for his two sons. Nothing holds his interest anymore&amp;#8212;not even riding his bike or his membership in the Raven Riders Motorcycle Club. But that all changes when he hires a new babysitter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently freed from a bad situation by the Ravens, Cora Campbell is determined to bury the past. When Slider offers her a nanny position, she accepts, needing the security and time to figure out what she wants from life. Cora adores his sweet boys, but never expected the red-hot attraction to their brooding, sexy father. If only he would notice her... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slider does see the beautiful, fun-loving woman he invited into his home. She makes him feel&lt;em&gt; too&lt;/em&gt; much, and he both hates it and yearns for it. But when Cora witnesses something she shouldn&amp;#8217;t have, the new lives they&amp;#8217;ve only just discovered are threatened. Now Slider must claim&amp;#8212;and protect&amp;#8212;what&amp;#8217;s his before it&amp;#8217;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>This Is Indy - Ross R. Olney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Motor racing is a dangerous sport. If you win, you can get rich, and live a comfortable life. But everyone doesn&#39;t win, and sometimes, but not too often anymore, a driver pays the ultimate price when he tries too hard to win. This book is about the Indy 500, written by an experienced writer who has raced, and a complete fan. He has driven on the track at Indy, and although his nickname at his local track, used with affection, of course, is &quot;Rollover Ross,&quot; he does love auto racing, and has written a number of books about it including his popular &quot;Daredevils of the Speedway.&quot; Racing at Indy is exciting, very dangerous, and attracts hundreds of thousands of fans from across the world and nearly four hundred thousand at the track. And many millions of fans on television. This is a gathering of what this author thinks are some of the highest, most dramatic moments at this one race, the once every year Indianapolis Speedway Race." />

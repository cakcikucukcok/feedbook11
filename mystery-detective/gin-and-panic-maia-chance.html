  <title>Gin and Panic - Maia Chance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets--and has a high old time doing it! So will you.&quot;--Ann B. Ross, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Miss Julia series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former socialite Lola Woodby is now struggling to make ends meet as a not-so-discreet private eye in Prohibtion-era New York City, along with her stern Swedish sidekick, Berta. When they&#39;re offered a piece-of-cake job--retrieving a rhinoceros trophy from the Connecticut mansion of big game hunter Rudy Montgomery--it seems like a no-brainer. After all, their client, Lord Sudley, promises them a handsome paycheck, and the gin and tonics will be plentiful and free. But no sooner do they arrive at Montgomery Hall than Rudy is shot dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the police arrive to examine the scene, they conclude that Rudy had actually committed suicide. But Lord Sudley can&#39;t believe his friend would have done that, and there&#39;s a houseful of suspicious characters standing by. So Lord Sudley ups the ante for Lola and Berta, and suddenly, their easy retrieval job has turned into a murder investigation. Armed with handbags stuffed with emergency chocolate, gin flasks, and a Colt .25, Lola and Berta are swiftly embroiled in a madcap puzzle of stolen diamonds, family secrets, a clutch of gangsters, and plenty of suspects who know their way around a safari rifle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gin and Panic&lt;/i&gt; is the next jaunty, compelling Discreet Retrieval Agency mystery from beloved crime writer Maia Chance.&lt;/p&gt;" />

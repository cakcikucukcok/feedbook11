  <title>The Adventure of the Busts of Eva PerÃ³n - Carlos Gamerro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1975. The cusp of Argentina&quot;??s Dirty War. The magnate, Fausto Tamerlán, has been kidnapped by guerrillas, who as part of their ransom demands have stipulated the placement of a bust of Eva Perón in all ninety-two offices of Argentina&quot;??s leading construction company, Tamerlán &amp; Sons. Tamerlán&quot;??s head of procurement, Ernesto Marroné, is the man tasked with the job, but he soon finds out that his is a mission for executives of a heroic disposition. His subsequent picaresque journey plunges him into a world of occupied factories, the slums of Buenos Aires and the utopian Evita City. Equipped with his trusty copy of Don Quixote: The Executive-Errant, Marroné is a modern knight who finds himself forced to penetrate the ultimate Argentinian mystery: Eva Perón &quot;?? that maid of myth and legend whom we know as Evita. A stand-alone novel in its own right but also a prequel to his first novel, The Islands (And Other Stories, 2012), Carlos Gamerro&quot;??s caustic and utterly original novel is a shattered window onto Argentina&quot;??s recent past." />

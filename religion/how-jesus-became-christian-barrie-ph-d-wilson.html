  <title>How Jesus Became Christian - Barrie Ph.D. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; How Jesus Became Christian&lt;/i&gt;, Barrie Wilson Ph.D. confronts one of the simplest--yet undiscovered--questions of religious history: How did a young, well-respected rabbi become the head of a cult that bore his name, espoused a philosophy he wouldn&#39;t wholly understand, and possessed a clear streak of anti-Semitism that has sparked hatred against the generations of Jews who followed him?  Vividly recreating the Hellenistic world into which Jesus was born, Wilson looks at the rivalry of the &quot;Jesus movement&quot;, informed by Matthew and adhering to Torah worship, and the &quot;Christ movement,&quot; headed by Paul which shunned Torah. Suggesting that Paul&#39;s movement was not rooted in the teachings of historical Jesus, but a mystical vision of Christ, he further proposes Paul founded the new religion through anti-semitic propaganda, crushing the Jesus Movement. Sure to be controversial, this is an exciting, well-written popular religious history that cuts to the heart of the differences between Christianity and Judaism.  &lt;i&gt;How Jesus Became Christian&lt;/i&gt; looks at how one of the world&#39;s great religions prospered and grew at the cost of another and focuses on one of the fundamental questions that goes to the heart of way millions worship daily: Who was Jesus Christ --a Jew or a Christian?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Voodoo Doll - Sylvia A. Witmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The beautiful Carolina coast is the setting for this novel.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Kimberly Marshall&#39;s life was one most women would envy. She was sincere, beautiful and was married to a very rich older man who worshipped her. Her world came crashing down around her the day she discovered a Voodoo Doll in the bottom drawer of her husband&#39;s desk. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The doll was made into the exact image of Kimberly, wearing a yellow dress identical to one of hers. She was shocked to discover the top of the dress wassmeared with blood and long straight pins pierced through the chest straight into the back.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Then, the threats began......someone connected to her household was trying to kill her and each attemptbecame worse than the last one. Kim enlists the help of a handsome neighbor to come to her rescue and help her solve the mystery and stop the killing before both of them become victims themselves.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Kim has a very hard time believing that her husband or anyone in his family is trying to murder her, but she discovers that only the persons in her household would have direct contact with her; the house is too well guarded for an outsider to be able to get that close to her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mystery, mayhem, romanceand an unusual secret are combined in this book and will keep the reader guessing until the very end.&lt;/P&gt;

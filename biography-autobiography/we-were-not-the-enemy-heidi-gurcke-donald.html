  <title>We Were Not the Enemy - Heidi Gurcke Donald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The United States clandestinely funds the operation of a huge prison in Cuba. Men, women, and children are spirited away from their homes and imprisoned indefinitely. No charges are made; no legal counsel is allowed. Newspapers fill with stories of espionage and enemies. Current events? No. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During World War II, the United States used tactics remarkably similar to those in use today against presumed terrorists. By 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt had covertly authorized J. Edgar Hoover&#39;s Secret Intelligence Service to begin surveillance of Axis nationals in Latin America. Believing that &quot;all German nationals without exception [are] dangerous,&quot; the United States surreptitiously pressured Latin-American countries to arrest and deport more than four thousand civilians of German ethnicity to the United States. There, many languished in internment camps, while others were shipped to war-torn Germany. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As my parents, German-born Werner Gurcke and his American wife, Starr, began their lives together in Costa Rica, he was falsely labeled one of the country&#39;s most dangerous enemy aliens. Soon she, too, was considered &quot;dangerous to the   safety of the United Nations.&quot; From newlyweds to parents, innocent civilians to dangerous enemies, prisoners to internees, &lt;I&gt;We Were Not the Enemy&lt;/I&gt; tells their story. &lt;/P&gt;" />

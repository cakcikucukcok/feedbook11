  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Al Franken’s Al Franken, Giant of the Senate - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Al Franken&#39;s Al Franken, Giant of the Senate includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Al Franken: Giant of the Senate is an autobiography written by Minnesota Senator Al Franken. It gives background on Franken&#39;s career as a comedy writer, on his campaigns for office, and on the workings of the Senate.
Franken&#39;s father was the child of German Jewish immigrants. He moved from New York to Minnesota to start a quilting factory, which quickly failed. He then became a printing salesman, and Franken, who was born in 1951, grew up in middle class suburbs. His family became Democrats during the Civil Rights era, in part because, as Jews, they identified with marginalized people and believed in equality for all. 
Franken&#39;s family wanted him to be a scientist. However, Franken discovered from an early age that he loved comedy, and he and a friend, Tom Davis, who was a year behind him at a private school, began to write skits and comedy for the school. When they became older they performed regularly at the local comedy club. 
Franken went to Harvard, where he met his wife, Franni, who came from a poor family. Franni was able to go to college thanks to government assistance. Franken sees the Democrats as the party of civil rights and of economic opportunity, giving people like Franni a chance to succeed." />

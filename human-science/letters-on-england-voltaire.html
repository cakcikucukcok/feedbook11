      <meta name="description" content="Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Marie Arouet, who called himself Voltaire, was the son of Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Arouet of Poitou, who lived in Paris, had given up his office of notary two years before the birth of this his third son, and obtained some years afterwards a treasurer&amp;rsquo;s office in the Chambre des Comptes. Voltaire was born in the year 1694.&amp;nbsp; He lived until within ten or eleven years of the outbreak of the Great French Revolution, and was a chief leader in the movement of thought that preceded the Revolution.&amp;nbsp; Though he lived to his eighty-fourth year, Voltaire was born with a weak body.&amp;nbsp; His brother Armand, eight years his senior, became a Jansenist.&amp;nbsp; Voltaire when ten years old was placed with the Jesuits in the Coll&amp;egrave;ge Louis-le-Grand.&amp;nbsp; There he was taught during seven years, and his genius was encouraged in its bent for literature; skill in speaking and in writing being especially fostered in the system of education which the Jesuits had planned to produce capable men who by voice and pen could give a reason for the faith they held.&amp;nbsp; Verses written for an invalid soldier at the age of eleven won for young Voltaire the friendship of Ninon l&amp;rsquo;Enclos, who encouraged him to go on writing verses.&amp;nbsp; She died soon afterwards, and remembered him with a legacy of two thousand livres for purchase of books.&amp;nbsp; He wrote in his lively school-days a tragedy that afterwards he burnt.&amp;nbsp; At the age of seventeen he left the Coll&amp;egrave;ge Louis-le-Grand, where he said afterwards that he had been taught nothing but Latin and the Stupidities.&amp;nbsp; He was then sent to the law schools, and saw life in Paris as a gay young poet who, with all his brilliant liveliness, had an aptitude for looking on the tragic side of things, and one of whose first poems was an &amp;ldquo;Ode on the Misfortunes of Life.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; His mother died when he was twenty.&amp;nbsp; Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s father thought him a fool for his versifying, and attached him as secretary to the Marquis of Ch&amp;acirc;teauneuf; when he went as ambassador to the Hague.&amp;nbsp; In December, 1713, he was dismissed for his irregularities.&amp;nbsp; In Paris his unsteadiness and his addiction to literature caused his father to rejoice in getting him housed in a country ch&amp;acirc;teau with M. de Caumartin.&amp;nbsp; M. de Caumartin&amp;rsquo;s father talked with such enthusiasm of Henri IV. and Sully that Voltaire planned the writing of what became his&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Henriade&lt;/i&gt;, and his &amp;ldquo;History of the Age of Louis XIV.,&amp;rdquo; who died on the 1st of September, 1715.&lt;br /&gt;

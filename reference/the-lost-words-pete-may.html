  <title>The Lost Words - Pete May</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Philip Howard&#39;s legendary &#39;Lost Words&#39; column has been appearing weekly in The Times for many years, wittily illuminating a raft of the most obscure, esoteric words the English language has to offer. At the same time, his &#39;Word Watching&#39; puzzles have provided readers with the chance to pit their lexicographical skill against his tongue-in-cheek multiple-choice conundrums. This unique collection, bringing together the very best of all these, is a feast for word lovers. Here we can lament the disappearance of words like &#39;accismus&#39; (an insincere and feigned refusal of something that is earnestly desired), and wonder why we ever thought we could do without &#39;zoilus&#39; (a censorious, malignant or envious critic). And, once we have completed our journey through the dictionary entries time has forgotten, there&#39;s more fun to be had, as we ponder whether having a &#39;tirrit&#39; means one is in possession of a trumpet, throwing a fit or the proud owner of a type of bird, and if the charge of being &#39;spissid&#39; is a comment on one&#39;s girth, sobriety or resemblance to a javelin, either literal or metaphorical. Endlessly fascinating, Lost Words continues Philip Howard&#39;s amusing and informative tour of words that enrich the English language and would otherwise have been lost forever." />

  <title>Shaking the Family Tree - Dallas H</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was a boogie man in the closet and its name was alcoholism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is not for the faint at heart. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shaking the Family Tree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an anonymous personal memoir of a recovering alcoholic. It is interlaced with poetic offerings that take the reader to the heart and soul of the ramifications of the disease of alcoholism. Dallas&amp;rsquo;s story is one of coming to terms with what has become her family&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate legacy. She and her sister were raised by two loving parents who did the best they could. As young girls growing up, they never doubted for one moment whether or not they were loved, and were infused with a strong sense of family values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcoholism wasn&amp;rsquo;t a stranger to the family. It could be traced back for four&amp;nbsp;generations and continues to reveal itself in three younger generations of Dallas&amp;rsquo;s family. In her memoir, Dallas explains her battle with co-dependency, weight, and the genetic predisposition for alcoholism being the single thread that ties it all together of what made her life a living hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas didn&amp;rsquo;t give up. Although she wanted to kick the habit, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. With the help of a loyal sponsor, a lot of determination, and several hard lessons Dallas now shares how she conquered her biggest demons and became a survivor of alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;" />

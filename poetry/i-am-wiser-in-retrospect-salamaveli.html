  <title>I Am Wiser in Retrospect - Salamaveli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am wiser in retrospect, is about the awakening of once naivety into this pernicious world that needs urgent demand for tranquility. It is about expecting and accepting hardships that may occur as we sojourn through these ponderous times of our lives, and not to eliminate any impossibility that a snag, will never mount up on that smooth and lovely road. It tells us that the unexpected is inevitable in ones life, and that when such circumstances emerge; one should find some courage in the grimmest of times to triumph over ones trepidations. In the poem &quot;gravestone&quot; the author, expresses his joy on how he had found hope among the numerous heaps of thorns and thistles. How under a nail his sins where no longer traced. How he had manage to embrace his faith regardless of the feelings of betray and disappointment in the God whom he solely trusted. He particularly stressed and recognizes the difficulties there is in crossing such a breach when the devil had intentionally planted a seed of doubts and reasons why one should never rely on this so call God.
What inspires me
Long sufferings, loneliness, obscurity and disappointments of life has rather turn into a positive tools of a thinking cap and a source of inspirations to him. He has written over 130 poems, many of which is based on love, correcting once mistakes, finding courage to move on at lowest times, and most especially, not to risk once life in the name of love or friendship, and to learn about the wolves that encloses our surroundings. As readers pick up a copy of I am wiser in retrospect, not only will you be encouraged or enlighten by the knowledge of uplifting, but I will be doomed if only I should boost up your confidence that the lyrics were glamorous all the way through; for I was in pain when I wrote, the inks of my pen only flowed when my heart was pressed to the limit." />

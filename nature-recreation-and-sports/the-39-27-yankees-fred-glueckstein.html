  <title>The &#39;27 Yankees - Fred Glueckstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Their names conjure up the golden era of New York Yankees history and the sport of baseball itself; names like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Earle Combs, Waite Hoyt, and Herb Pennock. Other baseball immortals playing against these Yankee greats in the roaring twenties were future Hall-of-Famers Walter Johnson, Ty Cobb, Lefty Grove, Eddie Collins, Jimmy Foxx, Tris Speaker, Mickey Cochrane, Bucky Harris, Red Faber, and others.
The 27 Yankees is a baseball book for all fans of the national pastime. It is the story of the most legendary and revered team in the annals of the game: the 1927 New York Yankees, whose magical name even today evokes the standard of excellence in Americas most treasured sport. The book is the definitive historical account of the men and their accomplishments as a team from Spring Training through the World Series. 
The 27 Yankees literally transports the reader back to that exciting and glorious season through the detailed and carefully crafted recreations of the games on the field and the events off the diamond. The book is unique in its concept and execution and sets a new standard for historical baseball research and presentation.
The 27 Yankees is, and will remain, the most complete historical account of the greatest team in baseball history." />

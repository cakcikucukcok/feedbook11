  <title>No Reprieve - Robert H. Seville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Ryker was a young man who had everything going for
him, until terrorism struck, killing everyone he loved. Anger turned
to focused purpose. James Ryker would soon become Americas
most elite special forces soldier and then a CIA operator. After
discovering that top U.S. offi cials were getting rich from the killing
of innocent Americans, Ryker decided to expose them, but failed.
Now, forced out, Ryker continues to watch as more and more
Americans are killed. Its time to end it. Rykers emotions take over
and he is compelled to take action. Its a race against right and
wrong, love and hate, to stop the men who allow terrorism to occur,
and to save thousands of lives. This time, failure is not an option." />

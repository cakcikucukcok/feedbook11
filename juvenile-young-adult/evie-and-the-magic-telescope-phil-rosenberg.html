  <title>Evie and the Magic Telescope - Phil Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Evie spends her summer vacation on the familys farm with her grandparents, she discovers much more than she figured she would when the summer began. Grandpa introduces her to the wonder and mystery of the nighttime sky. He shows her how to use his telescope. Like a ship that travels to unknown and distant shores, the telescope has a name: Angelina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Evie and the Magic Telescope&lt;/I&gt; tells the story of Evies adventures with Angelina. She turns from Evie the Shy into Evie the Hunter and Explorer. When she returns to school in the fall, she has changed. Everyone sees it. She sets aside her worries about the future. Like a true hunter and explorer, she revels in her clear and passionate vision of what lies ahead of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written especially for young people in their late elementary school and middle school years, &lt;I&gt;Evie and the Magic Telescope&lt;/I&gt; will appeal to older readers as well. Everyone who longs to find adventure in unlikely places and to discover a new and exciting path for their lives will enjoy finding out what happens when Evie meets Angelina.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Transition - Luke Kennard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The sort of book that cuts you off from your family and has you walking blindly through seven lanes of traffic with your face pressed obliviously to the page.&quot; --James Marriott, &lt;i&gt;The Times &lt;/i&gt;(London)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you or your partner spend more than you earn? Have your credit card debts evolved into collection letters? Has either of you received a court summons? Has either of you considered turning to a life of a crime? You are not alone. We know. We can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While taking part in the Transition, you and your partner will spend six months living under the supervision of your mentors, two successful adults of a slightly older generation. Freed from your financial responsibilities, you will be coached through the key areas of the scheme--Employment, Nutrition, Responsibility, Relationship, Finances, and Self-respect--until you are ready to be reintegrated into adult society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of your six months, who knows what discoveries you&#39;ll have made about yourself? The &quot;friends&quot; you no longer need. The talents you&#39;ll have found time to nurture. The business you might have kick-started. Who knows where you&#39;ll be?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Flawed - Jo Bannister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can waste a lot of time looking . . . or you can pay me to find it for you.&quot; So goes the slogan of Brodie Farrell&#39;s one-woman detective agency. Although Brodie has made some surprising---and dangerous---discoveries while working as a modern-day treasure hunter, none of them has turned her life upside down in quite the way that her unexpected pregnancy does. &lt;br&gt;The timing is particularly awkward because Brodie has recently separated from her partner, the prickly Detective Superintendent Jack Deacon. To complicate matters further, Detective Inspector Alix Hyde has set her sights on Deacon while simultaneously trailing a mysterious criminal---and one-time friend of Deacon&#39;s---Terry Walsh, who has a habit of springing surprises of his own.&lt;br&gt;As ever, Brodie&#39;s best friend, Daniel Hood, will do anything to help her---even taking a leave from his beloved teaching job so that he can look after her business while she takes care of the baby. But soon Daniel is preoccupied with the well-being of young Noah Selkirk, who seems to be collecting more bruises than is reasonable even for a twelve-year-old boy, and is strangely linked to the Walsh case as well. . . . &lt;br&gt;As their entanglements weave together in complex patterns, all of the parties have to face the consequences of their own mistakes. But it&#39;s the flaws that make all of us human---and perhaps that ultimately make us stronger.&lt;/p&gt;" />

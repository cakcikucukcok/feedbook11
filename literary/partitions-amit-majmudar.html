  <title>Partitions - Amit Majmudar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A stunning first novel, set during the violent 1947 partition of India, about uprooted children and their journeys to safety&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As India is rent into two nations, communal violence breaks out on both sides of the new border and streaming hordes of refugees flee from blood and chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an overrun train station, Shankar and Keshav, twin Hindu boys, lose sight of their mother and join the human mass to go in search of her. A young Sikh girl, Simran Kaur, has run away from her father, who would rather poison his daughter than see her defiled. And Ibrahim Masud, an elderly Muslim doctor driven from the town of his birth, limps toward the new Muslim state of Pakistan, rediscovering on the way his role as a healer. As the displaced face a variety of horrors, this unlikely quartet comes together, defying every rule of self-preservation to forge a future of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dramatic, luminous story of families and nations broken and formed, &lt;i&gt;Partitions&lt;/i&gt; introduces an extraordinary novelist who writes with the force and lyricism of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>God’S Gift - Lorner J. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forgive in order to live is my motto. As a former victim of unforgiveness, I repeat this mantra to help me as well. My goal is to help others do the same. Because of my experiences as a child and as an adult, I was inspired to write Damaged Women, How to Rehabilitate, and Is It Discipline or Child Abuse? I want you to be inspired as you read this book of poems and scriptures titled Gods Gift. Oftentimes we cant say what we feel, but writing it down makes it easier. My objective is for you to know that you can survive through forgiving. Just enough faith can give you strength to make it. In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. He said just speak it, and no matter whats standing in your way, it shall be moved. Forgiveness is the first step in your healing process. Use your trials as stepping stones to a solid foundation. Keep believing and stay positive in everything you do; God will work it out for you. Im encouraged to move forward and remain hopeful of every situation that comes before me. From this point on, dont let anything hold you down; rebuke it and keep moving. My favorite poem is The Swinging Door. My favorite scripture is Psalm 34: I will bless the Lord at all times. He took me form the dirt and healed the hurt in me. Thanks to everyone in my life, and may God truly bless you." />

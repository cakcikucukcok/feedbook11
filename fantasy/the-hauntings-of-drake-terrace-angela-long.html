  <title>The Hauntings of Drake Terrace - Angela Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alexander Holloway is three days away from his thirteenth birthday when he senses something dangerous is looming in his future. After his uncle accuses him of digging into their family secrets while attending Drake Terrace boarding school, Alexander heads toward Professor Holloways office hoping to find some answers. But just as he is about to arrive, he sees a dark shadow under the headmasters window. There is no question that there is something evil at Drake Terrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things go from bad to worse after Alexander meets Professor Moondare, a scary looking science teacher who gives him a bad feeling. After the headmaster confirms his suspicions and tells him he is in more danger than ever before, Alexander realizes the shadow is stalking him and he must do everything in his power to save his dead fathers most prized possession. As a loud howl haunts the schools hallways, students begin disappearing, another student stumbles upon open graves, and a professor finds a secret door. But everything comes to a head on Halloween night as Alexander attempts to outrun evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this supernatural tale, a dark shadow haunts the hallways of a boarding school, exposing secrets and leaving the fate of one of its students in the hands of his classmates, professors, and a presence from the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />

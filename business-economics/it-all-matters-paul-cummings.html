  <title>It All Matters - Paul Cummings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The all-encompassing framework for achieving the life of your dreams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It All Matters&lt;/i&gt; presents a framework for the rest of your life. What are those dreams you would only dare to dream if there was no possibility of failure? How can you live a life of real intention and purpose instead of duty and obligation? This book answers these questions and more. Everyone has the capacity to author their own destiny; it&#39;s not our circumstances that shape our lives, it&#39;s our &lt;i&gt;response&lt;/i&gt; to those circumstances that either propels us to great heights or keeps us stuck in the mud. Here, author Paul Cummings shares one of the most comprehensive goal setting systems ever put into print. Based on the key U.B.U. process—Understand who you are, Be true to yourself, and always be Unique—this framework gives you the power to transform your life. Through a fast-moving series of engaging stories, you&#39;ll learn how to question yourself to greatness as you begin to think in bigger and more positive terms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professionals from across the globe have implemented this framework to achieve what they &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; wanted out of life—isn&#39;t it your turn? This enlightening guide teaches you the revolutionary strategies that can help you make big things happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dig deep to find your &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; dreams, and set a plan to achieve them&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover the core principles the form the foundation for success&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn the art of self-questioning as a motivational tool&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Implement a comprehensive, proven system for getting what you want&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are one great question away from everything you ardently desire at all times. Are you ready to take the leap? &lt;i&gt;It All Matters&lt;/i&gt; shifts your perspective to let you see the shining path ahead.&lt;/p&gt;" />

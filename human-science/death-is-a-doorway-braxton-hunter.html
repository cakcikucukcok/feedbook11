  <title>Death Is a Doorway - Braxton Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Is death the end? Will there really be an afterlife? Does the Christian teaching about Heaven actually bring anyone real peace? Having been plagued by such questions, the author set out to find answers. This book is the result of one man&#39;s struggle with the certainty of the grave. In the first half, the scriptures are applied in an attempt to develop a Christian view of demise. However, section two draws on the best evidence from philosophy, science, history and personal experience that death is not the end. Throughout the book various types of death are examined and each one is likened to a doorway. If death is a doorway, everyone has their own idea of what it will look like. All of this enables the reader to construct a healthy view of death&#39;s door so that they may one day pass gracefully. Whether you are wrestling with the death of a loved one, facing the end of your own life, or live in fear of the grave, &lt;EM&gt;Death is a Doorway&lt;/EM&gt; was written for you. &lt;/P&gt;

Written expressly for overseas buyers, Garretts book takes you through the entire buying process in Floridafrom selecting the right Orlando area, to property selection, to financing, and right through to contracting and renting, showing you what to watch out for each step of the way and how to get ahead. Buyers from overseas have spent $50 billion-plus on more than 250,000 properties in Florida from 2009 to the summer of 2013, according to data from the National Association of Realtors, yet there is very little information out there specifically on the Florida market for the savvy buyer who wants to ensure that they do everything correctly and make the best choices. Garretts book addresses that gap in an easily accessible all encompassing guide. This book has all you need to know for buying and owning property in Central Florida." />

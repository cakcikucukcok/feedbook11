  <title>This Is What It Feels Like - Rebecca Barrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This tender story of friendship, music, and ferocious love asks: what will you fight for, if not yourself?&lt;em&gt; You Don&amp;#8217;t Know Me But I Know You &lt;/em&gt;author Rebecca Barrow&amp;#8217;s next book is perfect for fans of Katie Cotugno and Emery Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who cares that the prize for the Sun City Originals contest is fifteen grand? Not Dia, that&amp;#8217;s for sure. Because Dia knows that without a band, she hasn&amp;#8217;t got a shot at winning. Because ever since Hanna&amp;#8217;s drinking took over her life, Dia and Jules haven&amp;#8217;t been in it. And because ever since Hanna left&amp;#8212;well, there hasn&amp;#8217;t been a band. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It used to be the three of them, Dia, Jules, and Hanna, messing around and making music and planning for the future. But that was then, and this is now&amp;#8212;and now means a baby, a failed relationship, a stint in rehab, all kinds of off beats that have interrupted the rhythm of their friendship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like the lyrics of a song you used to play on repeat, there&amp;#8217;s no forgetting a best friend. And for Dia, Jules, and Hanna, this impossible challenge&amp;#8212;to ignore the past, in order to jump start the future&amp;#8212;will only become possible if they finally make peace with the girls they once were, and the girls they are finally letting themselves be.&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

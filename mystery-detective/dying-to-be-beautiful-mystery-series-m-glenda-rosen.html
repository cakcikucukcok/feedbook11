  <title>Dying to Be Beautiful Mystery Series - M. Glenda Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fake Beauty The author of best-selling book, Looking Beautiful, isnt looking so beautiful. Out in The Hamptons, the dead body of Jordan Kennedy is found stuffed into the window of a local bookstore, which was then set on fireburning Jordan along with copies of her book. She was supposed to do a book signing, but it seems someone has murdered her instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat Free &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus DElroy has spent the morning of every New Years Day combing The Hamptons beaches with his metal detector. He does it to remember his father and the activity they once shared before his dads untimely death. This particular first day of the year, Marcus finds something frightening and disturbing: a dead body, covered in a large gold satin scarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tough and glamorous Private Investigator Jenna Preston, murder in The Hamptons is becoming all too common, especially with so many people dying to be beautiful. Fortunately, Jenna has the help of her Irish Setter, Watson. Shes got two new mysteries to solveand quicklybefore someone else ends up dead, thanks to the multi-million-dollar world of beauty and the things people will do to attain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYING TO BE BEAUTIFUL is a fascinating look into the multi-million dollar world of beauty and the things people will do to attain it. [Rosen is] a fun and engaging storyteller who clearly knows her way around a plot twist or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK PUBLISHING AGENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a Head [Book 1]  a quirky female private investigator novel that will keep readers hooked with its charm, wit and suspense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; CITY BOOK REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause and more applause for Dying to Be Beautiful, the book and the characters, including a beautiful setter dog named Watson (smart, protective, and necessary to the plot) [who] brings humor and humanity to the whole. I loved it. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;An adult desire…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sebastian Ferrari had accused Kate of being a spoiled, selfish child and his harsh words had made her angry. Why couldn&#39;t her stepbrother accept that she&#39;d grown up and changed? Her feelings for him were certainly different - her teenage infatuation had deepened into very adult desire… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kate knew that she was more than ready to meet and work with Sebastian on equal terms. She was no longer a girl; she had to convince him that now she was all woman and that she wanted an affair - with him!&lt;/p&gt;

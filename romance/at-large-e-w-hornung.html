  <title>At Large - E.W. Hornung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During a formative period in his early adulthood, English-born author E. W. Hornung spent several years working as a tutor at a desolate outpost in the Australian wilderness. This experience proved to be instrumental as a source of inspiration in his later work. The intricately plotted mystery novel At Large unfurls against the backdrop of the unforgiving Australian landscape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E.W. Hornung (7 June 1866 &amp;ndash; 22 March 1921) was an English author and poet known for writing the A. J. Raffles series of stories about a gentleman thief in late 19th-century London. Hornung was educated at Uppingham School; as a result of poor health he left the school in December 1883 to travel to Sydney, where he stayed for two years. He drew on his Australian experiences as a background when he began writing, initially short stories and later novels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1898 he wrote &amp;quot;In the Chains of Crime&amp;quot;, which introduced Raffles and his sidekick, Bunny Manders; the characters were based partly on his friends Oscar Wilde and his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, and also on the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, created by his brother-in-law, Arthur Conan Doyle. The series of Raffles short stories were collected for sale in book form in 1899, and two further books of Raffles short stories followed, as well as a poorly received novel. Aside from his Raffles stories, Hornung was a prodigious writer of fiction, publishing numerous books from 1890, with A Bride from the Bush to his 1914 novel The Crime Doctor." />

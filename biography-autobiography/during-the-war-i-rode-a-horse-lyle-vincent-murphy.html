  <title>During the War I Rode a Horse - Lyle Vincent Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book tells the story of the 10th Australian Light Horse during World War One. It takes the reader on a journey with the first enlisted men from West Australia from their enlistment, through training at Black Boy Hill, their encampment at Meadi, Egypt, the call to Gallipoli and then the slow process of taking the Sinai, the drive through Beersheba to Jerusalem and finally their capture of Damascus. The war for the 10th did not stop here because they had to maintain the peace. Eventually the men returned home.
The story is told through the eyes of the author&#39;s father,Trooper Herman John Murphy. With a mixture of well researched fact added to a little fiction the Author takes a fresh look at an old topic capturing the essence of the Anzac: Courage, Mateship, Initiative, Self Reliance, Sense of Humour and very little respect for authority and military protocol. The underlying message of the book is the meaningless waste of human life in war." />

  <title>Bedroom Roulette: TruLOVE Collection - Anonymous, Ron Hogan, BroadLit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;What was love really like in the 1970s? Women were marching forward in the Women&amp;#8217;s Movement, &amp;#147;bringing home the bacon,&amp;#8221; exercising their newfound sexual freedom, and still searching for true love. Introducing, Bedroom Roulette, the latest book in the TruLOVE Collection series, guest edited by romance book expert Ron Hogan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bedroom Roulette is a collection of 13 love stories focused on the changing lives, loves and careers of women in the &amp;#145;70s.  It&amp;#8217;s hard to resist these tantalizing tales with titles like:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;         &amp;#147;Bedroom Roulette &amp;#150; The Game Suburban Housewives Play&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;         &amp;#147;We Joined Our Teenage Daughter at a Free-Love Farm&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;         &amp;#147;The Night My Husband Demanded an Orgy&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;         &amp;#147;Why Not? We Used To Be Married&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hogan provides a revealing look at various kinds of love stories from the early 1970s in America. Topics that were previously taboo were now being discussed in &amp;#147;polite&amp;#8221; society. The sexual revolution was in full swing and the feminist movement was taking hold. Pop culture is alive and well in Bedroom Roulette as it gives readers a &amp;#147;fly on the wall&amp;#8221; peek at a pivotal moment in American cultural history. Many of the stories included in this TruLOVE Collection will surprise&amp;#151;and possibly shock--the reader.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

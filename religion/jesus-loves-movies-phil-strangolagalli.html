  <title>Jesus Loves Movies - Phil Strangolagalli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intriguing title, eh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drama. Comedy. Thriller. Action. Jesus loves them all. And yes, even horror movies. Why? Because movies mean a lot to us. We quote them on the daily and they influence our lives. So, if Jesus loves us, don&amp;rsquo;t you think that movies would also mean a lot to Him? Isn&amp;rsquo;t He supposed to be personal?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cinema is a spiritual sanctuary. It can be a place of healing, a place where you can hear the validating voice of a personal and very present God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus Loves Movies provides you with thirty films that will draw you into a cinematic experience with the most creative Director. Use this book as a devotional, a guide, or in any way that you desire. May it show you that God is in everything. May it lighten your load and demonstrate to you that He is fun, interesting, and deep. May the pages of this book open your senses to a side of God that the modern day church sometimes struggles to understand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written during a season of deep pain, grief, and injustice; analyses of thirty films contained in the pages of Jesus Loves Movies will bring you to a secret movie space. A space where the most Holy One will adorn you with His peace, love, and restoration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to sit back and relax, grab some popcorn, watch some movies, and get ready to experience God in a way that you were made to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is Phil Strangolagalli&amp;rsquo;s first book and it was never planned. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil is recently married to his beautiful wife, Kathryn (the real Wonder Woman) and they don&amp;rsquo;t live far from the Daily Bugle. In Phil&amp;rsquo;s spare time you can find him taking long walks in the movie theater, teaching his wife about the complexity of film, and talking to strangers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil is excited for how this book will reveal to you a side of Jesus that he believes people must know&amp;mdash;an intimate, fun, actually very real God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

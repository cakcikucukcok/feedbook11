  <title>Controlled Women &amp; Constipated Men - Dr. Terence C Teasdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Terence Teasdale&#39;s new book enters interesting and heretical territory in the minds of many, especially women.
Dr Teasdale&#39;s book explores the tyranny of the female gender in a way that one hundred or so other books deride the opposite gender. It is a most timely book (long overdue). The ladies should be able to handle it, as indeed we are all equal!
Dr Teasdale&#39;s book is confronting and controversial. A lot of women will hate it!
Jeffrey James
This book is not a feel good book.
This book will not enrapture most women. Certainly, not those I call controlled women. But, there again, it is not meant to imparadise women, even though its entire contents are devoted to them.
The book is about women who are psychologically disturbed. And this means most women. It is about women who are controlled for their entire lives by negative emotions: emotions that are so potent that they convert into disabling mental disorders, gobbling-up self-esteem, and by bizarre and inappropriate behaviour, impairing and even destroying relationships.
For sure, this book is about the severe damage controlled women inflict on
themselves and others, especially their vulnerable children.
Neurosis and depression in women and our late adolescents are increasing at an alarming rate. Controlled women are a demoralised gender." />

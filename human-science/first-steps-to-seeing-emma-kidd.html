  <title>First Steps to Seeing - Emma Kidd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the twenty-first century we are confronted with a rapidly changing world full of social, economic and environmental uncertainties. We are all inherently connected to this changing world and in order to create the best possible conditions for life to thrive, we must each develop an inner capacity to respond and adapt to life in new, creative and innovative ways.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;The author of this visionary book argues that the path to a happy, healthy and peaceful world begins with the individual. By learning to recognise our cognitive habits of interrupting and defining life through our fixed ideas, labels and judgements, we can begin to develop a dynamic way of seeing that enables us to perceive and respond to life with greater attentiveness.&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;First Steps in Seeing reveals a practical set of stepping stones that guide the reader into this dynamic way of seeing and relating. Using personal stories, practical exercises and real-world case studies in development, education and business, the author takes the reader on a journey to explore how to give our full attention to life, and how to enliven the world that we each co-create. An inspiring guide for all those working for social change in youth work, business, education or research, or simply seeking fresh paths in life." />

  <title>New American Knits: Classic Sportswear Patterns - Amy Christoffers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;Practical and stylish pieces for daily life!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New American Knits&lt;/i&gt; offers garments that are casual but polished, equally appropriate whether running errands, at the office, or socializing with friends. Author Amy Christoffers takes her inspiration from the clean lines and elegant functionality of American sportswear and creates projects that have a classic nostalgic feel. In designing her fashionable modern uniform, Amy focuses on beautiful everyday sweaters, tops, and pretty accessories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Included are sections on texture and lace and pops of colorwork to add visual and knitterly interest. Projects feature traditional, seamless, and semi-seamless construction as well as detailed finishing. &lt;i&gt;New American Knits&lt;/i&gt; has a &quot;country house&quot; feel with touches of heather grays, tweeds, slubby textures, and muted tones. The book is visually elegant with a streak of casual bohemian style, much like the projects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />

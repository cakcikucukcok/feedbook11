  <title>An Asperger Journey - Scott Verbout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within a span of two months in late 2006 and early 2007, Scott Verbout learned he had a mental disabilityand then lost his job of more than fifteen years. After going through that traumatic experience, which he partially attributes to his condition and the failure of others to understand it, Scott began the process of writing about his experiences. Ultimately, his research became the basis for &lt;i&gt;An Asperger Journey.&lt;/i&gt;
As Scott researched his condition, he found a wealth of information for children who have Aspergers syndrome, but not much similar guidance available for adults. To give the full picture, Scott asked his wife and daughter for their contributions, as they have lived with him and have had to deal most intimately with the effects of the disorder. He wanted to share his experiences with others who have Aspergers, as well as with their family and friends. 
By sharing his journey of discovery as an adult with a lifelong mental disability, Scott hopes to help others who may have had similar experiences." />

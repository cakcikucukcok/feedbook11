  <title>Driftwood Ellesmere - James Davidge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The amazing origin of our heroine is learnt as Driftwood and her friends grapple with a monster that creates evilly hypnotic video games.
It was during a normally quiet day on Ellesmere Island that Old Bart was interrupted by a pregnant woman floating towards him in an old rowboat. The woman came onto shore, quickly gave birth to a wee girl and died shortly after. The orphaned Driftwood Ellesmere was raised by Old Bart, Clara the Maid and Wilson the Cook in the Toque and Mitt Inn, the most northern hotel in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until she is sixteen does Driftwood leave the island for the first time to begin working as a counselor at Camp Magee in British Columbia. Her fun with her new camp friends is interrupted when the last session of kids arrive all entirely addicted to small video game boxes. None will do a single outdoor activity. They growl and try to bite if anyone interrupts their playing of their repetitive consoles. Why is a shy young northern girl the best hope in finding a way to free the children from their electronic chains?
This is how a wondrous story begins that tells both of how Driftwood grew up learning magical things in Arctic isolation and of her first exciting adventure off the island. Traveling with her best friend, Rose, to New York City, the Grand Cayman Islands and beyond Driftwood tackles the problems of the world head on. On her journey she ever learns more about her mysterious past and her truly amazing potential." />

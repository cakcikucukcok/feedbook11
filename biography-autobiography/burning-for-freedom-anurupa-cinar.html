  <title>Burning for Freedom - Anurupa Cinar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of one mansVinayak Damodar Savarkars sacrifice of his name, fame, comfort, and family life in the fifty years of his quest for the freedom of his beloved motherland, India. It is the story of politics and power plays. Exposed here is the reality that lies behind the mask of Truth; exposed are the shenanigans of Mahatma Gandhi in the Freedom Movement of India. The reality is a far cry from the rosy picture presented by what passes as history.
Here, Savarkars life is creatively intertwined with a fictional character, Keshav Wadkar, taking the reader from the horrors of the Cellular Jail in 1913 to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. Savarkar fought to preserve the integrity of India, to reinstate the honor of his motherland without ripping her heart out. For the emancipation of his beloved country and people, he suffered agonies and gross injustices at the hands of the British government, Gandhi-Nehru-led Indian National Congress, and the successive Governments of free India.
That his contribution to India should be negated to bolster the political aspirations of any political party is unacceptable.
The truth cannotand shall notbe hidden!" />

  <title>The Right Thing to Do - Josephine Gattuso Hendin, Mary Jo Bona</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;On a stroll in his Queens neighborhood, Sicilian-born Nino Giardello glimpses his daughter, ambitious nineteen-year-old Gina, heading for the subway. Silently, he follows her to Manhattan and watches, outraged, as she walks into the arms of a golden-haired stranger. The incident confirms Nino&#39;s worst suspicions about his decidedly American daughter. It also challenges Nino&#39;s power as capofamiglia, a disruption to his ideas about family life, and an insult to his heritage. In a struggle that exceeds all boundaries, including death, father and daughter will engage in a conflict of generations that is likewise a conflict of cultures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Josephine Gattuso Hendin captures New York Italian immigrant life with startling precision, bringing to life the intricate web of a community&#39;s everyday transactions and exploring the multifaceted father-daughter relationship at the heart of the Italian American family. A coming-of-age novel that is both wryly funny and achingly sad, &lt;I&gt;The Right Thing to Do&lt;/I&gt; burns with the conflicting desires of two cultures, two generations, two sexes, each with its own intensely defined needs and ethical systems.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Good People, Bad Managers - Samuel A. Culbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There&#39;s far more bad management behavior taking place today than the well-intentioned doling it out realize... and even more than those on the receiving end are aware of! There&#39;s little mystery about what good management entails; the biggest mystery is why people are calling this bad behavior &quot;good enough.&quot; Today&#39;s managers work in a success and self-preservation mindset, which doesn&#39;t always translate to a productive and mission-oriented environment. Too many erroneous assumptions are involved when following the mainstream tenets of work culture, which sap morale, well-being, and performance at both the individual and organizational levels.
In &lt;em&gt;Good People, Bad Managers: How Work Culture Corrupts Good Intentions&lt;/em&gt;, author Samuel A. Culbert makes readers aware of what bad habits are routinely followed by well-intended managers. Managers need to understand the causes for their constant distraction, become more aware of the negatives they inadvertently inflict, and the hollowness of the rationales they use to justify what they do. Company leaders, CEOs, and top tier managers need to become more aware of the ever-present concerns of their own workforce, implementing the management mentality they want in their company and then teaching their managerial employees how to absorb it.
Culbert offers practical advice for effecting this necessary cultural change in the workplace. Peppered with illuminating and helpful case studies throughout, this is the perfect guide for showing managers exactly how to conduct themselves more intelligently, and, as opportunities arise, in a manner that contributes to the common good." />

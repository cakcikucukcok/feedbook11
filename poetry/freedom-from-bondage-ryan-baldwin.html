  <title>Freedom from Bondage - Ryan Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Freedom from Bondage: The Poetic Messages of a Warrior, is a compilation of 30 Spoken Word works inspired by The Holy Spirit and customized to inspire the lives of others and encourage faith in THE MOST HIGH, as well as, the gifts that HE has blessed each one of us with, for the purpose of empowering HIS Chosen People to unceasingly fight the good fight, as we face various adversities, trials and tribulations. The messages contained within this unique piece of workmanship contain soul-penetrating words impactful enough to abduct the attention of their readers, as mental portraits are being painted by them. 
Freedom from Bondage, contains stimulating subject topics ranging from single-motherhood and poverty,  to unwavering determination and praise. It is a celebration of where faith will lead us to when we believe that THE MOST HIGH is for us, has pre-established the pathways before us, and that nothing formed against us will ever prosper. Expressions of pain are entailed between these pages, as well as, the promise of a brighter day.
Freedom From Bondage, is living proof that even after incarceration or surviving through the devastating hardships we encounter in life, nothing can stop GOD from moving through Us, around Us, or on Our behalf. This book serves as a vessel of light. It aims to ignite minds to hope, to dream, to set goals, to strive, to grow, to create, to accomplish, to overcome, and to recollect that impossible is nothing.
Freedom From bondage, demonstrates unconditional love, purposefulness, servanthood, strength, determination, victory, steadfastness, humility, intuition, vision and creativity, amongst numerous other matters of great significance. Its not only an invitation into Mr. Baldwins world, but is also a journey through his struggles. This uniquely worded compilation of poetic messages exposes how freedom from all the unwanted energy, self-defeating behavioral patterns, and/or negative thoughts, can be experienced through self-expression. Since discovering peace &amp; freedom through writing, it has lead Mr.Baldwin to making this book available to others." />

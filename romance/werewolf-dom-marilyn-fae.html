      <meta name="description" content="Tasha is eighteen-years-old with nowhere to go. She&amp;#39;s lucky that she&amp;#39;s picked up by Madame Nijah, owner for a risqu nightclub that offers her patrons entertainment of a different kind. &amp;quot;I have a client who just lost his Submissive,&amp;quot; she says, eyeing Tasha up and down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She can&amp;#39;t help but squirm. She doesn&amp;#39;t look exactly her best right now. &amp;quot;You could be his type.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nijah looks at her considerately for a long moment. Long enough that Tasha would&amp;#39;ve started worrying about her driving if the road wasn&amp;#39;t still completely straight and there was no other cars on the road. &amp;quot;Do you want to know what I do for a living, darling?&amp;quot; she asks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasha nods, curiousity getting the better of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I provide a safe space for people to reenact their deepest, darkest, sexual fantasies,&amp;quot; she says smoothly. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not bad-looking. You could be one of my girls,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasha tenses, hugging her bag closer. &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Relax, darling. I won&amp;#39;t make you do anything you don&amp;#39;t want to. But if you want to...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curiousity has always been one of her worst traits. &amp;quot;If I want to what?&amp;quot; Tasha prompts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I have a client who just lost his Submissive,&amp;quot; she says, eyeing her up and down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasha can&amp;#39;t help but squirm. She knows she doesn&amp;#39;t look particularly attractive right now. Her clothes are torn in several places, her face a mess of tears and dirt, and her hair hasn&amp;#39;t been watched in days. She waits for the woman to say &amp;#39;forget it&amp;#39; and dismiss her, except Madame Nijah opens her mouth and says:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You could be his type.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What type?&amp;quot; she asks. Surely someone like her can&amp;#39;t be anyone&amp;#39;s type right now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A natural submissive,&amp;quot; Madame Nijah states a matter-of-factly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m- I&amp;#39;m not a natural submissive.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Madame Nijah cocks her brow again. &amp;quot;Got you in the car without even having to raise my voice, didn&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasha blushes. &amp;quot;You seem like a nice person.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a very nice person,&amp;quot; Nijah reassures her with a laugh. &amp;quot;Raphael is my best client. Pays for the room on time, brings his own submissive and shares her with my other clients without asking for discount,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I just rent the room for him and makes sure it&amp;#39;s clean. He&amp;#39;s a good guy and his sexual preferences are easy enough. You don&amp;#39;t have anything against werewolves, do you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasha shakes her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re petite, so he&amp;#39;ll have to work you up to taking him and his knot. I bet you&amp;#39;ll both enjoy the process. He&amp;#39;s particularly fond of high-end toys.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasha doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with her because instead of pulling back in disgust at the vivid descriptions of what the man intends to do to her, she asks, &amp;quot;What if he doesn&amp;#39;t like me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then, he&amp;#39;ll pay for your services and I&amp;#39;ll find someone else to his liking. I have a feeling that won&amp;#39;t be a problem, darling. I can tell you&amp;#39;re exactly his type.&amp;quot;" />

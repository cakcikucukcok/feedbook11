  <title>The Secret Life of a Submissive - Sarah K</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah K has a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By day she’s a writer and level-headed single mother; by night she’s a submissive, living a real-life Fifty Shades of Grey that is thrilling beyond her wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But this is no fantasy: Sarah’s story is all true.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Daring, evocative and thrilling, but told with wit and honesty, this is an explosive account of life as a submissive, and of a secret world in which only a few dare to play.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Max comes into Sarah’s life – charming, handsome and deliciously brooding – she can’t resist. She surrenders to him in every way: he is a dominant, and Sarah becomes his submissive, yielding her body to his every desire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But as Sarah pushes her mind and body to its limits – performing acts E.L. James would blush at – she begins to realise that she’s in too deep. Pleasure and pain have become her world; she’s addicted to the adrenalin, to the sensation and to Max himself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now she’s in serious danger of giving in to the ultimate temptation: falling in love…&lt;/p&gt;

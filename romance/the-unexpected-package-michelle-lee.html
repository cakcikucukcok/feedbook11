  <title>The Unexpected Package - Michelle Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty-two-year-old Kay Stewart is on top of the world. For the past eleven years, she has let nothing interfere with her climb to achieve notoriety as a New York fashion designer with her own line, label, and international success. Determined to never succumb to the patter of little feet and picket fence syndrome, Kay is more than ready to welcome the rewards she has worked so hard to achieve. But all of that is about to change when Kay receives a strange message on her answering machine.
Kay barely has time to figure out who the message is from when her doorman delivers an unusual package. When she peers inside, Kay is shocked to discover its contents: a baby boy. With only an anonymous note supposedly penned by someone from her childhood to provide clues, Kay faces a complex dilemma: who would entrust their baby in her care? When she is forced to explain the babys sudden appearance to her long-time boyfriend, his unexpected reaction to the news sends her on a journey into her past where she soon unearths much more than just the babys identity.
In this novel, a career woman whose life is turned upside down by an unforeseen package is about to discover that nothing is predictable, especially when it comes to babies, love, and the future." />

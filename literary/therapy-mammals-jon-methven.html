  <title>Therapy Mammals - Jon Methven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Tom Pistilini has just discovered he’s an unwitting investor in a macabre tourism company bringing wealthy European sightseers obsessed with America’s murder culture to explore mass shooting sites. It’s a business that will make him wealthy, although he might just despise it enough to ruin his neighbors, and himself, financially.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Told from the first-person perspective of unreliable narrator Tom “Pisser” Pistilini, the Patrick Bateman of the private school community, &lt;i&gt;Therapy Mammals&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the lengths one father will go to protect his children, his marriage, and his worthiness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pisser’s life is a mess. He recently emerged from a pharmaceutical blackout to find himself strangling the captain of the high school lacrosse team against the bathroom wall of Gopa Academy, a premier Manhattan private school. His wife is having an affair with a motivational speaker. His job as Channel Fourteen’s meteorologist is in jeopardy. His nanny died in a freak accident, of which he may have been involved. It is also possible he murdered the lacrosse coach with a four-iron. A group of millennial hackers has discovered the tourism business. He has a chipmunk infestation in his backyard. His wife’s vertical pancake business, Standcake, is on the verge of ruin. His son is a cross-dressing geriatric. Controversial photographs of his daughter are circulating. Various factions of parents are aligned against him, but who can blame them: he stole a prosthetic leg and an equipment bus, causing the lacrosse team to forfeit an important game. He kidnapped a feral cat, hoping it would clear his yard of chipmunks while also behaving as his therapy pet. He named it Clint Eastwood. His cat is pregnant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;Therapy Mammals&lt;/i&gt; is an intriguing romp through modern parenthood navigating class privilege, digital media, hacker culture and gun violence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

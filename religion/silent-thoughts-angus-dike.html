  <title>Silent Thoughts - Angus Dike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods word stretches as a parapet from the eternal past across the present into eternity. Christ has journeyed between the times. In His word He instructs and by His spirit He guides us into the age to come. Beyond space and time, well above the realms of human language and thinking, God speaks, and what He says, none can annul! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of God is so meaningfully structured and arranged such that one cannot add, subtract or change one verse, one word, one chapter or book without impairing on the harmony and meaning of the whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the word our hearts are assayed, our deeds are graded and words are judged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlining structure, forms and functions of the universe are based on the word of God  the eternal emblem, crest and seal on all creation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Everything is controlled from the centre, the scientist calls it the nucleus but I call it the word  the centre and source of all life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is the glue that holds the bits and pieces of the scriptures together, if we neglect Him the scriptures will fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian is limited not by his physical abilities or lack of it but by his spiritual insights and revelations, his knowledge of Gods word and will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never look down to test the ground before obeying the voice of God, if you are willing to take the risk, God will confirm His word with great testimonies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each verse, each chapter and book of the bible is a complete whole yet a part in a larger whole and must be interpreted in line with the larger whole- the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never allow yourself to become a slave to the tyrants, the errand sons of hell. Use the sword of the spirit- the word of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

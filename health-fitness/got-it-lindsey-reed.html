  <title>Got It! - Lindsey Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Would you like to have confidence? To be productive and able to just get things done? To live a stress-free life? Then this book is for you.&amp;nbsp;Imagine a life where you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Naturally feel confident and comfortable with yourself&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a clear mind, clarity, and decisions become easy to make&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;See life much lighter with more laughter&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have more energy, becoming more productive effortlessly&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Enjoy an enriching life, both at work and home&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find that any conflict (inside and out) is overcome within minutes rather than hours, days or weeks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That life is just a short read away! This book will give you a profound understanding of the human mind, and the implications of this understanding are astounding.&amp;nbsp;Are you ready to discover a new confident, productive, stress-free life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the teaching of author and philosopher Sydney Banks, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got It! The Answer to a Confident, Productive and Stress-free Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers an introduction to the Three Principles: Mind, Consciousness and Thought. There is nothing &amp;lsquo;to do&amp;rsquo;. &lt;strong&gt;Author Lindsey Reed&lt;/strong&gt; shares the&amp;nbsp;understanding of these Three Principles with insight, clear explanations, case studies and personal experience. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all born with confidence &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s in our blueprint! However it can be obscured and misunderstood, leaving us feeling unconfident, unproductive and anxious. This can massively affect our relationships with money, time, health, self and with others. When we understand the principles of how we as humans innately work, then we are able to&amp;nbsp;re-discover our true confidence and lead a more fulfilled life that is ultimately more productive and less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the book, allow the words to wash over you like waves and allow the lightbulb moments to follow&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;Got it!&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got It! The Answer to a Confident, Productive and Stress-free Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lindsey invites us to trust ourselves and let go of those unhelpful thoughts which obscure our natural confidence. Her own experiences, combined with her genuine enthusiasm for her subject, make it easy for the reader to &amp;lsquo;get it&amp;rsquo; and relate to her themes.&amp;quot; Catherine de Salvo, Director, Scott Bradbury Limited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a personal, succinct and insightful book that explores a new approach to understanding confidence, a new way of thinking about overthinking and some powerful thoughts about the power of our thoughts.&amp;rdquo; Simon Gardner, CEO Step Up Consultancy, and former CMO of Hasbro Inc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How refreshing, a book that can change so much by changing so little. No tools, no techniques, just principles that when paid attention to will change your life.&amp;rdquo; Andrew Richman-Bolt, Naked Gurus CEO: Executive coach and trainer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This book offers you Lindsey in letters! She shares her experience of weaving the 3 principles into her life. This book definitely needs to be read if you want to learn and know that you can make changes to fully experience this planet and trust yourself.&amp;rdquo; Helen Askey, Coach, facilitator and cappuccino maker&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Ginty&#39;s Ghost: A Wilderness Dweller&#39;s Dream - Chris Czajkowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;After nearly three decades of wilderness dwelling far from neighbours and roads, with the nearest community accessible only via float plane or days of hiking, Czajkowski purchases a derelict homestead with rough road access at Ginty Creek, an hour&amp;#8217;s drive south of Anahim Lake. Although the property is mostly swamp and the packrat-infested buildings are uninhabitable, the location affords beautiful views and abundant wildlife&amp;#151;and the asking price is within her budget.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ginty Creek was named for Ginty Paul, the eccentric recluse who had previously owned the property. Some locals remember Ginty affectionately, while others feared her volatile temper or refused to step into her house for fear of being served &amp;#147;chicken poop tea.&amp;#8221; She had an open-door policy to all of her animals&amp;#151;the chickens would sleep with her and the bedroom doubled as a maternity ward for dogs, cats, goats and sheep. Intrigued by the stories,&lt;BR&gt;Czajkowski tracks down a pile of Ginty&amp;#8217;s letters and documents. These, combined with many fond, bitter and bizarre anecdotes gleaned from interviews with area residents, are all woven into the account.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Czajkowski chronicles the many challenges of settling into her new home, it becomes clear that she and Ginty have more than just a piece of land in common. They also share a spirit of independence and resourcefulness, as well as an unwavering desire for a solitary life immersed in the spectacular landscapes of British Columbia.&lt;/div&gt;" />

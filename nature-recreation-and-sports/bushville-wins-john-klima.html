  <title>Bushville Wins! - John Klima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bushville hits the sweet spot of my childhood, the year my family moved to Wisconsin and the Braves won the World Series against the Yankees, a team my Brooklyn-raised dad taught us to hate. Thanks to John Klima for bringing it all back to life with such vivid detail and energetic writing.&quot; -- David Maraniss, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Clemente&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;When Pride Still Mattered&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rip-roaring story of baseball&#39;s most unlikely champions, featuring new interviews with Henry Aaron, Bob Uecker and other members of the Milwaukee Braves, &lt;i&gt;Bushville Wins!&lt;/i&gt; takes you to a time and place baseball and the Heartland will never forget.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, the New York Yankees were the biggest bullies on the block. They were invincible: they led the New York City baseball dynasty, which for eight consecutive years held an iron grip on the World Series championship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953, becoming surprise revolutionaries. Led by visionary owner Lou Perini, the Braves formed a powerful relationship with the Miller Brewing Company and foreshadowed the Dodgers and Giants moving west, sparking continental expansion and the ballpark boom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rest of the country wasn&#39;t sold. Why would a major league team move to a minor league town? In big cities like New York, Milwaukee was thought to be a podunk train station stop-off where the fans were always drunk and wouldn&#39;t know a baseball from a beer. They called Milwaukee &lt;i&gt;Bushville&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Braves were no bushers! Eddie Mathews was a handsome home run hitter with a rugged edge. Warren Spahn was the craftiest pitcher in the business. Lew Burdette was a sharky spitball artist. Taken together, the Braves reveled in the High Life and made Milwaukee famous, while Wisconsin fans showed the rest of the country how to crack a cold one and throw a tailgate party. And in 1954, a solemn and skinny slugger came from Mobile to Milwaukee. Henry Aaron began his march to history. &lt;br&gt;With a cast of screwballs, sluggers and beer swiggers, the Braves proved the guys at the corner bar could do the impossible - topple Casey Stengel&#39;s New York baseball dynasty in a World Series for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Strange Possession at Viner Sound - Robin Percival Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have written about seven stories that I put away and have occasionally revised. One story started when I was anchored alone in Viner Sound in 1996. I felt a presence on board that set off my imagination. The book contains the stories of six lives. Two half breeds, Matti Wilson (part Finish and part Indian) and Bessie David (part Kwakuutl Indian and part Chinese). Chief Joseph of the Koeksotenok in the village of Gwayasdums. Shaman Caring-well in the village (cousin of Matti) and shaman to Chief Bell of the Tsawatenok. Lad and Jojo (sons of Chief Bell) held captive at a secret Japanese radio base in Viner Sound during WWII and died there. Jojo had not been given the rites at burial that would send him to Transformer for reincarnation and his spirit is trapped in Viner Sound. Jojo&amp;#39;s spirit possesses Matti and shows him how the boys died at the radio base. He asks Matti for assistance in releasing his spirit for passage to Transformer so that he can be reincarnated. The lives of these main characters are interwoven in the novel&amp;#39;s narrative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of spiritual possession was reinforced in 2002, when a Haida woman told me about her possession by the bad spirit of Hot Spring Island in the Gwai Hanas Park on the Queen Charlotte Islands.  In 2012 I decided to self-publish, Strange Possesion at Viner Sound, to raise funds for my charities." />

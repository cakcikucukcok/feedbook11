  <title>Living Free - Karen Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She tried to run. She tried to hide. Her life, for thirty years, was spent living behind a mask holding onto her imperfections or what she thought were imperfections. No one knew the real her. Author Karen Hope didnt know the real her. 
In Living Free, she shares how fear, shame, and guilt held her back from living the life she was created to live. Her journey was filled with traumas, old wounds, hurts, and layers of fear and anger. She didnt know who she was. In the memoir, Hope tells how she engaged on a trek, a journey back to finding her true authentic self. She narrates how she confronted the past to break free from religious abuse and control and the courage and faith it took to understand and know she could live her life as her real person. 
Honest, personal, and self-reflective, Living Free offers a story of Hope finding herself and her own freedom. Through her journey, she encourages others to step out in faith to the love and peace they deserve." />

  <title>Daphne and Leopold - Barbara Ann Deane, Jennette Conners</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This inspirational children&#39;s book about a Dragonfly and a Lion who become best friends in a Land called ONE shows children how we are all connected to one another and the importance of thinking positively.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever heard of a dragonfly and a lion roaming around the jungle as best friends? Perhaps you have never heard of a land called One, where all the animals and insects come to realize the importance of their connection to each other, and how their thoughts affect all of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enchanting tale gave Barbara Deane the courage to fully open her heart to invite love in during the last few weeks of her life. During this time, as she lay confined to her bed in an amazing hospice, which has a butterfly logo, she created this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Everyone who entered Barbara&#39;s room was inspired by her to make a butterfly, and soon beautiful butterflies and dragonflies decorated the walls of her room. Then one day, a faithful friend brought her a very special dragonfly, a helium-filled balloon, and Barbara immediately called her Daphne. Daphne became animated and would turn to stare lovingly at Barbara. Shortly after that, she received the gift of a large stuffed lion. He was endearingly named Leopoldher final inspiration. Barbara knew that lions embody strength and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The words started flowing, and Barbara was so thrilled to finally be telling the story that was inside of her that the excitement was contagious. The staff became involved and passionate about the story as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Once the story was told, Barbara was ready to go hometo her heaven. She had found a way to share her light with the world. After all, she knew dragonflies remind us that, we are light.&lt;/p&gt;" />

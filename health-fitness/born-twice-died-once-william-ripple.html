  <title>Born Twice, Died Once - William Ripple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born Twice, Died Once
The book reflects the ups and downs of a walk with Jesus.  Read it and compare it to personal walk of faith with Jesus Christ.  My hope is that it will encourage you to look at your life according to your faith.  God, through Jesus Christ, is able to sustain you and keep you through life.  He is our victor.  He paid the price and already died for your sins.
So please read this book.  Its a matter of life and freedom from sin or a road to condemnation.  After you read this book, you will know beyond a reasonable doubt that Jesus loves you.
Many may think, Oh!  He needed to God!  But thats ok right now.  Whether I needed God or not, let me say that is a reality that there is God.  And its not you.  The earth speaks of the many realities of God and His Christ.  I challenge you to read this book.  It will surely lead you to a deeper relationship with the Creator of all things, including mankind.
In His grip,
Willie Ripple
John 3:16:  For God so love the world  that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life." />

Now that she has an imprint of her own, Violet&#39;s &quot;gift&quot; is intolerable. Torn between her desire to lead a normal life and the pressure from the Center to continue her work tracking down killers, Violet&#39;s world starts to unravel . . . and some of her most carefully guarded secrets are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she discovers a gruesome murder scene unlike anything she&#39;s ever encountered, and she can&#39;t rest until she&#39;s silenced the echoes for good. As Violet sets out to find a vicious murderer and his band of devoted followers, she realizes that protecting those closest to her is far more difficult than protecting herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

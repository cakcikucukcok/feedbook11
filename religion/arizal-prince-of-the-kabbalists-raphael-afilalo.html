  <title>ARIZAL: Prince of the Kabbalists - Raphael Afilalo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Ari overflowed with Torah. He was expert in Scripture, Mishnah, Talmud, Midrash, Maaseh Bereishit and Maaseh Merkavah. About all the different levels of prophecy, their details and from which level the prophets had their revelations. &amp;nbsp;He understood the whistling of the trees, the grass and stones, the language of the birds and other animals, the conversations of angels, the flicking of a candle. He could read lines on the hand or faces in the manner outlined in the Zohar (2:74b). He could discern all that any individual had done, and could see what they would do in the future. He could read a person&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, even before the thought entered his mind. He saw future events and knew about all happening here or decreed in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;He understood the mysteries of reincarnation, who had been born before or incarnated for the first time. He could talk to the soul of a person in front of him; know of his previous incarnations, what he did from the day he was born until now and what his present Tikun is. He could tell anyone about his sins in his previous life and why he came back in this present life. &amp;nbsp;He could look at someone and let him know how he was connected to higher spiritual levels and what is his original root in Adam Harishon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Ari could see extraordinary things about someone in the light of a candle or through the flame of a fire. He was able to see the souls of the righteous, those who had died lately or had lived in ancient times. With these souls he studied supernal secrets. By a person&amp;#39;s scent he was able to know all that he had done. The evildoers avoided him, he could see though them and know what they did or thought. When sincere men wanted to repent, then he would tell them what was their exact Tikun to restore and completely repair their souls. He would tell his students how lost souls would come to him by the thousands whenever he was in the fields. They would fill the trees, the rivers and ask him to help and repair them. He knew every deed a person had done or would do in the future, see his thoughts and foresee all his future ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

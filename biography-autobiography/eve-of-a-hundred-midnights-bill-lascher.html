The couple had worked in China as members of a tight community of foreign correspondents with close ties to Chinese leaders; if captured by invading Japanese troops, they were certain to be executed. Racing to the docks just before midnight, they barely escaped on a freighter&amp;#8212;the beginning of a tumultuous journey that would take them from one island outpost to another. While keeping ahead of the approaching Japanese, Mel and Annalee covered the harrowing war in the Pacific Theater&amp;#8212;two of only a handful of valiant and dedicated journalists reporting from the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by deep historical research, extensive interviews, and the Jacobys&amp;#8217; personal letters, Bill Lascher recreates the Jacobys&amp;#8217; thrilling odyssey and their love affair with the Far East and one another. Bringing to light their compelling personal stories and their professional life together, Eve of a Hundred Midnights is a tale of an unquenchable thirst for adventure, of daring reportage at great personal risk, and of an enduring romance that blossomed in the shadow of war.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>How to Survive a Near Death Experience - John Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written from the events that took place from 1995 till the present day, with a lot of questions I have had as I grew up. Who am I? Why am I here? What is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched the Scriptures and completed my doctorate,, hoping to find these answers, but they only came when I had my first NDE in 1995. I was told this is the only way you can learn the answers to these questions, so I listened. I was told at the beginning that if you go to court to get justice, all you get is law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will speak to readers in many different ways, because what is necessarily true on one level is not necessarily true on another, in other levels we not only see horizontal but vertical as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 3:1To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very thought that a you can be dead and not know it is very disturbing; the possibility that man being dead while he is alive is very startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things were explained to me, I hope you can find the truth of them also.&lt;/p&gt;" />

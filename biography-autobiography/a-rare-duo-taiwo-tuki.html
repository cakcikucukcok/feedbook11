  <title>A Rare Duo - Taiwo Tuki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A RARE DUO is the chronicle of highly valued events that took
place in the Authors growing up as a child and her closeness with her
twin sister and how it has transformed her into the very person she has
become. This book also stresses on how it has transformed her growth
and understanding of others, and the legacy both her parents have left
for her to live by.
It isnt until you come to a spiritual understanding of who you are as a
person, or necessarily get a religious feeling that deep down the spirit
within you begin to take control. Part of being able to enjoy life to its
fullest is to master the skill of goal setting, and then leave chasing life
and accomplishing those goals and dreams." />

  <title>Associate Training Manual - Michael A. Gray M.A.Ed.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your knowledge of police ethics or lack thereof determines your experience!
Every sworn officer knows, or at least should know by now, that they live in a glass jar. Friends, relatives, neighbors, and strangers watch every move law enforcement officers make both on and off duty. The fact is that the public scrutinizes police officers more than most other professions, either because theyre cynical or hope to catch them screwing up or because they&#39;re hopeful and are looking for a good example and a strong leader. In either case, it&#39;s up to the officer or civil service worker to be above reproach in both his public and private life. The major difference between most sworn officers or civil service workers and extremely successful officers or civil workers is the gap between what they know and what they do. Both groups have about the same knowledge base. Extremely successful officers and civil service works are just better at doing what they should be doing.
I worked as a special deputy sheriff early in my young life, and there were times I lost my temper to the point where I wanted to cross ethical boundaries. I wrote this powerful, high-impact workbook to help fellow officers by educating them in police ethics so that they wont become a victim of poor decision making, placed in the lime light of shame, and made the poster child for law enforcement ethical dilemmas. 
Using this ethical workbook in your organization will show your employees youre serious about their professional growth and achieving critical ethical goals and objectives. This ethics in law enforcement workbook allows you to train entire police departments for less than the cost of traditional public seminars or other training options. Give your officers and civil service workers the skills, knowledge, and confidence they need to meet tough workplace challenges while on patrol or while working in a civil service position. This workbook will help them realize their full potential and perform at their peak, provide them with the tips and techniques they will need to stay calm and productive in any situation." />

  <title>Earth Journal - William J. Bly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Earth Journal  was written by the author in the summer of 1972 at age 21. Only a few ending pages, a few updates and corrections; the biography of Sir Thomas More; including the images, were added in May 2010. This non-fiction account is both a commentary on planet earth; a brief history of its age; its place in the solar system as being unique by possessing life; and a  brief account of the first &quot;Earth Day,&quot; as it happened from my 1970 perspective as a college freshman. The book is  also a collection of aphorisms, poems, humor, and observations, creating a unique backward glance at 1972,, and my youthful thoughts and opinions. However, the book has been formulated to honor Sir Thomas More, my world famous 15th great grandfather. A collection of public domain photos and a short biography of this great man, a Saint in the Catholic and Anglican Churches, and truly, &quot;A man for all seasons,&quot;  has been added. As the author combines his 1972 writings with the photographs and biography of Sir Thomas More, Mr. Bly celebrates both earth and More as unique entities- one a planet; and the other, a man who gave up his life on earth to oppose the King of England, on moral grounds, This book is a one-of-a-kind creation, it&#39;s non-fiction qualities blended with biography, as well as artistic and spiritual discussions. Though challenging in thought, it&#39;s a book to be enjoyed for its humor and wit, as well." />

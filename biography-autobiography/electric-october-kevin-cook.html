  <title>Electric October - Kevin Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The epic World Series between the Yankees and the Dodgers and the six men whose lives were changed forever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1947 World Series was &quot;the most exciting ever&quot; in the words of Joe DiMaggio, with a decade&#39;s worth of drama packed into seven games between the mighty New York Yankees and underdog Brooklyn Dodgers. It was Jackie Robinson&#39;s first Series, a postwar spectacle featuring Frank Sinatra, Ernest Hemingway and President Harry Truman in supporting roles. It was also the first televised World Series - sportswriters called it &quot;Electric October.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for all the star power on display, the outcome hinged on role players: Bill Bevens, a journeyman who knocked on the door of pitching immortality; Al Gionfriddo and Cookie Lavagetto, bench players at the center of the Series&#39; iconic moments; Snuffy Stirnweiss, a wartime batting champion who never got any respect; and managers Bucky Harris and Burt Shotton, each an unlikely choice to run his team. Six men found themselves plucked from obscurity to shine on the sport&#39;s greatest stage. But their fame was fleeting; three would never play another big-league game, and all six would be forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Cook brings the &#39;47 Series back to life, introducing us to men whose past offered no hint they were destined for extraordinary things. For some, the Series was a memory to hold onto. For others, it would haunt them to the end of their days. And for us, Cook offers new insights--some heartbreaking, some uplifting--into what fame and glory truly mean.&lt;/p&gt;" />

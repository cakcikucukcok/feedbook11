  <title>Escape from Hell&#39;s Corner - E. Roy Hector</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gangs of bloodthirsty and ruthless outlaws terrorized the American Southwest before and after Mexico ceded the land now called Texas. One such pack of thirty or forty cutthroats had what they thought was a perfectly impregnable hideout until a trio of U.S. Marshals was given the mission of bringing them to justice. These marshals were no barroom toughs, they&#39;d been brought up church-going citizens, and all three had been schooled in the art of self-defense and survival.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The leader of this outlaw gang made a fatal mistake when he ordered a rancher&#39;s beautiful virgin daughter kidnapped. His gunmen terrorized this beautiful maiden with a rattlesnake while threatening her with a life of abuse and humiliation at the hands of the outlaw boss.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The boss of this lawless low-life gang of killers took great pride in using his blacksnake whip to maintain his unshakeable hold on his captives and even on the outlaws if they displeased him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He and his gang killed for the thrill of watching the innocent die. Members of this gang would lead the marshals on a chase throughout the Southwest and across the Rio Grande into Mexico, leaving a bloody trail of robbery and death.&lt;/P&gt;" />

Not everybody is happy with the change. Zesty is struggling to keep his courier business afloat and is falling behind on rent, while his brother, Zero, owner of a moving company stocked with ex-cons has hired an unemployed rabbi who begins to exert a strange influence on the family and delivers most of his sermons with his fists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a rock and roll legend suspected of murdering his girlfriend reappears after thirty years on the run, Zesty is once again haunted by his family&#39;s dark past and the mounting evidence that his father, Boston&#39;s former Poker King now suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s, has long been dealing from the bottom of the deck. From shady bars to college campus underground poker leagues, Zesty&#39;s speeding toward trouble, desperately trying to map out a future in a town where stop signs are optional, signaling is for the weak and Karma lurks around every corner with payback on its mind.&lt;/p&gt;" />

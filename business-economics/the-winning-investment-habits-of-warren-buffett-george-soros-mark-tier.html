  <title>The Winning Investment Habits of Warren Buffett &amp; George Soros - Mark Tier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and George Soros all started with nothing---and made billion-dollar fortunes solely by investing. But their investment strategies are so widely divergent, what could they possibly have in common?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mark Tier demonstrates in this insightful book, the secrets that made Buffet, Icahn, and Soros the world&#39;s three richest investors are the same mental habits and strategies they all practice religiously. However, these are mental habits and strategies that fly in the face of Wall Street&#39;s conventional mindset. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Buffett, Icahn, and Soros do not diversify. When they buy, they buy as much as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-They&#39;re not focused on the profits they expect to make. Going in, they&#39;re not investing for the money at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-They don&#39;t believe that big profits involve big risks. In fact, they&#39;re far more focused on not losing money than making it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Wall Street research reports? They never read them. They&#39;re not interested in what other people think. Indeed, Buffett says he only reads analyst reports when he needs a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Winning Investment Habits of Warren Buffett &amp; George Soros&lt;/i&gt; you can discover how the mental habits that guided your last investment decision stack up against those of Buffett, Icahn, and Soros. Then learn exactly how you can apply the wealth-building secrets of the world&#39;s richest investors to transform your own investment results.&lt;/p&gt;" />

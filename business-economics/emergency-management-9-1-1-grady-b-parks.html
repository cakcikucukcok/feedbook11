  <title>Emergency Management 9-1-1 - Grady B. Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now that you have read this book, I hope it has brought you new meaning in becoming a better manager and leader. You must learn to address issues more than once; reinforce them more than twice and you will reap the rewards three times over. You must be willing to invest the time required to learn the intricacies of your job. Secondly, you must learn to accept and respect the knowledge of others. The person who has the fountain of knowledge must be identified, praised, and nurtured as an invaluable asset for your personal growth and development. You should not be a clock-watcher. However, you must learn to work smarter and not harder. Always be cognizant of others shortcomings and faults. Ask yourself these questions:
(a)	What would you have done differently if the same set of circumstances were on your business plate? 
(b)	Would you have been more successful in handling the situation? 
(c)	Were you too critical in evaluating the results of the person making the decision? 
Evaluating yourself and the circumstances will assist you in formulating a plan of action to address and resolve issues before they occur.
Successful supervisors, managers, and leaders know the importance of treating employees and customers with dignity, honor, and respect. This is a sacred rule in building a team and fostering good human relations. How many people do you know that are more satisfied with their working environment than their pay? This individual will remain with a company because of his or her supervisors great people skills. It is imperative that you consistently display authentic and humanistic concerns for your employees. They are your keys to achieving success, and without them, you will become an army of none. It would be wise to remember that threats do not produce long-term changes but merely generate survivability skills." />

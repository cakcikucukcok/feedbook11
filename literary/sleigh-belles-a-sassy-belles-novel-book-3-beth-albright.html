  <title>Sleigh Belles (A Sassy Belles Novel, Book 3) - Beth Albright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Join the Sassy Belles - It&#39;s Christmas, Southern-style!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her hair perfectly coiffed, nails freshly manicured and a heavy trail of perfume wafting behind her, local news reporter Dallas Dubois is sure she’s about to kick her career – and maybe her love life – into high gear. The director of the Tuscaloosa children’s Christmas play has fallen ill and Dallas is ordered by her station manager to take the reins. Everyone is shocked – especially Cal Hollingsworth, who still remembers her as the Ice Queen from high school.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If nothing else, Dallas has never met a challenge that a little lip gloss and a Chanel knock-off couldn’t fix. But she has no idea how to relate to these kids and their brutal honesty is giving her pause. Things are made even more complicated by the butterflies she gets&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;whenever Cal is near…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when long-lost family members re-enter her life, Dallas’s icy veneer begins to melt. And, with Cal by her side, she soon realises that it’s what’s under all the hair spray that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sexy Southern fun… with a hint of magnolia! theSassyBelles.com&lt;/p&gt;

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Parallel - Lauren Miller</i></b> | Review first appeared on my blog: Book Addict 24-7 I received a copy from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review Parallel by Lauren Miller is a young adult sci-fi debut that explores the “what-if” theme. It is a very unassuming novel that begins like many other young adult novels with fluffy story lines.<br /><b><i>Parallel by Lauren Miller - Goodreads</i></b> | Author Lauren Miller bases her suspenseful and sensitive sci-fi novel on this multiverse theory but cleverly has main protagonist Abby knowing that she is existing in parallel with herself. Her condition comes about via some form of global earthquake as Abby takes a decision in the last year of high school on which subject to choose to fit her planned career, and she chooses drama.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Parallel (9780062199782): Miller, Lauren: Books</i></b> | Lauren Miller is an entertainment lawyer and television writer. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two kids. ... An intricately–woven story about free will, parallel universes, and cute boys. Miller nails the inner snark of the high school senior, as well as the confusion of figuring out just where your life is supposed to be headed.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Parallel - Lauren Miller</a> </h3></p><hr/>

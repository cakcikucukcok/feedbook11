  <title>Ndi-Igbo of Nigeria - Ndubisi Nwafor-Ejelinma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book comes, first of all, as the answer to the yearning for more written literature on the identity of the Igbo people of the southeast of Nigeria. The early chapters deal with their geographical and historical identity. Then it holds a searchlight on the Igbo worldview: their sociocultural values and traditions, their religious conceptsthe nature and character of the supreme being; their family agnates, relationships, and the structure and elements of social control dynamics, which are unknown to the Western world. The showcase also discusses some very powerful elements and traditions that give the Igbo their peculiar identity: the kola nut tradition, Igbo name, and food culture. This book is also a road map of the Igbo experience in the context of Nigerian histopolitical developments from 1914 to 1976: the crises, the pogrom, and the Biafran phenomenon, and the Ikemba Saga. 
Other hallmarks of this book include the profile of great personages: Igbo greatest heroes past and present, the icons of Igbo identity on both national and international scenes. And finally, it concludes with the roll call: an amazing catalog of more than four thousand Igbo traditional names." />

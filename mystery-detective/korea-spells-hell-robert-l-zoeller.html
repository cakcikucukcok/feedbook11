  <title>Korea Spells Hell - Robert L. Zoeller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of an individual from the time of going into the service
during the Korean War and the experiences had during that time.
A journal recording events of that time, some of these events will
cause the reader to smile and maybe even laugh aloud; other events
may be to sadden them and to maybe feel some of the pain felt by
those that this writing may depict. The Korean War is said to be the
forgotten war, but it will never be forgotten by those that were in it or
the friends and families of those that didnt return or those that carry
wounds, and missing parts of their body or maimed by this terrible
time. These are the reminders they will never forget. For these are
the reminders of the so called Forgotten War.
This book is therefore dedicated to all service men and women past,
present, and future with the special thanks to those that have made
the ultimate sacrifice for their country." />

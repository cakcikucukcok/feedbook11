  <title>Adyghe Khabze - Kadir I. Natho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book &quot;Adyghe Khabze&quot; is about the customs and traditions of the Adyghe (Circassian) people, who are one of the oldest people in the world with a unique language and distinctive culture, appeared larger than life in the historical arena of the world in far distant times, survived the ancient civilizations of the Babylonians, Assyrians and Hittites and contributed to the world culture the Heroic Nart Epics, the Promethean Spirit and the world renowned Maikop Culture. Their rituals, customs and traditions, which are described in this book, are actually their ancient unwritten code of life and honor, Adyghe Khabze, and deal with such vital human qualities as kindness, compassion, honor and conscience. Those who follow them seriously, whether they are Adyghes or not, will certainly become pure in soul and heart, true to their words and will learn to live honestly, without deceiving themselves or others, without interfering in the affairs of others, without subservience and genuflection to the powerful in this world of ours, respecting the opinions of others with a lofty human dignity, understanding their situation, helping and protecting the weak, standing up for the degraded and insulted for the sake of fairness and justice, living by their honest work, without stealing, envy and greed and raising children according to the norms of high moral and spiritual values of Adyghe Khabze, respecting elders and honoring the women, the tender givers of life.
	In short, my dear reader, I hope you will read this book and find it pleasurable, interesting, informative, wholesome and beneficial." />

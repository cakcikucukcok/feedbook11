  <title>Start Small Grow Slow Make a Difference - Maha Juffali-Ghandour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the 1980s, children with intellectual disabilities needed special services that were unavailable in either hospitals or regular school settings. Mainstreaming and inclusion were still ideas of the future. To address this matter, the Help Center was established in 1985. It is the first private philanthropic nonprofit organization in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia dedicated to the welfare of people with intellectual disabilities, from as early as birth to young adulthood and beyond.
In Start Small, Grow Slow, Make a Difference, author Maha Juffali- Ghandour offers a guide detailing how the nonprofit center was started, how it functions, and the lessons learned during thirty years of service. From its early days, the Help Center served just three clients and now assists 350 students. Through a holistic approach, providing a range of both educational and therapeutic services to the children and their families, the center empowers them to become active, vocal, and productive members of the community. 
More than a history of a single organization, Start Small, Grow Slow, Make a Difference offers tips and guidance for those who seek to open and operate a similar philanthropic nonprofit of their own. Al-Juffali discusses the three essential building blocks to ensure a solid foundation designed to achieve any vision: start, grow, and learn." />

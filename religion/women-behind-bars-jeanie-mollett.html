  <title>Women Behind Bars - Jeanie Mollett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You dont really know what goes on behind prison bars unless you live there. You can visit someone in prison and still not have a clue as to the emotions and torments they experience on a daily basis. There are many different kinds of bars. Some are physical, and some are spiritual. Some are emotional, and some are literal. No matter what kind they are, they will keep you bound and feeling powerless. Are you the kind of person who lives your life behind bars?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although sometimes there is no escaping from the bars we live behind, there is a way to live a victorious life. You need to remember that the bars that surround you do not define you. There is a woman in the Bible who lived her entire life behind bars of one kind or another. We can learn a lot from her experiences. Her name is Michal, the first wife of King David. Her father was King Saul. You would think the daughter of a king would have an almost perfect life. After all, she is a princess. Sometimes we judge things from an outward perspective without taking the time to look into the heart. I want to dig deep into the bars that held this woman captive most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

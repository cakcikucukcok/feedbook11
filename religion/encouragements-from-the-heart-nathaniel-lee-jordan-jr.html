  <title>Encouragements from the Heart - Nathaniel Lee Jordan Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We go through life everyday with issues bombarding us from North, East, South, and West.  We constantly cry out for understanding.  Usually when we cry out, there&#39;s no one there.  What do we do?  Who do we talk to?  Yes, on the outside everything looks fine, but on the inside-well, that&#39;s another story.  Sometimes it&#39;s just not convenient to talk to you.  I need more trust in my life.  I need more understanding.  I just want to know that I&#39;m not the only one in this world going through.&lt;/p&gt;
I pray that you find PEACE in this book.  For as long as I can remember, I&#39;ve always tried my best to encourage someone.  We&#39;ve all come to a point in our life or will come to a point in our life when we just need someone to encourage us.  I believe the more encouraged a person is, the more productive they become.  Take time to read this book and take in what you need to make it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
May God continue to bless you and heaven continue to shine upon you from this day forth.  Amen." />

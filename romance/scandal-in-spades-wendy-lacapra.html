  <title>Scandal in Spades - Wendy LaCapra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Lusciously romantic and sparkling with wit, &lt;/i&gt;Scandal in Spades&lt;i&gt; will captivate you until the very last page.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; -Anna Campbell, bestselling author of the Dashing Widows series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the Marquess of Bromton, honor is everything. So when he discovers he&#39;s a bastard, he attempts to manipulate a high-stakes card game to bestow his estate upon the rightful heir. But the winner demands more than Bromton bargained for--a marriage...to his scandal-ridden sister. Lady Katherine may be the least marriageable lady in all of England, but a child of their union would be a true heir. Only his wife-to-be is not at all like he expects...and she has no interest in marrying him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scandal has hardened Lady Katherine and narrowed her world to duty and family. There&#39;s nothing to be trusted in the Society she left behind, especially not the imperious marquess with his single-minded pursuit. Or his knee-weakening kisses. Except, the more their connection deepens, the more Bromton surprises Katherine. But the truth about their courtship could destroy everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Lords of Chance series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Scandal in Spades&lt;br&gt;* Heart&#39;s Desire&lt;br&gt;* Diamond in the Rogue&lt;/p&gt;" />

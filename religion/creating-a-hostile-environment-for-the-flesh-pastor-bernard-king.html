  <title>Creating a Hostile Environment for the Flesh - Pastor Bernard King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God has graciously granted Bernard King over thirty years of ministry experience. In 1981, at Syracuse University, Bernard surrendered his life to the Lord Jesus Christ and received His gift of salvation and the forgiveness of sins. He immediately became active in ministry and served as campus president for Campus Bible Fellowship. He also co-labored with other ministries, such as Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Athletes in Action.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard answered the call to be on staff at Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale, where he was ordained and served as a minister and an assistant pastor for nine years. In 2008, Pastor King started a Bible study in West Delray Beach. That Bible study was the catalyst for Cornerstone Bible Fellowship, where he now serves as senior pastor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard has BS (speech communications) and MS (counseling education) degrees from Syracuse University. His life verse is He must increase, but I must decrease (John 3:30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He purposes to promote Jesus Christ as the most prominent presence and person in his life. For Gods glory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard and his wife Gloria have been married for twenty-five years. They reside in Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;" />

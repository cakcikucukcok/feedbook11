  <title>Love... from Seed to a Tree - Gaurav Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The best part of Gauravs poems is that you can relate to most of them. He has
created magic with his words which takes you through a series of emotions which
never fail to touch your heart and leaves you with a nostalgic feeling. Such work can
only be expected from a person who is mature and sensitive and I am so glad I know
one such remarkable person .&lt;br&gt;
-Mita Nitin Bakshi, Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gaurav as a person and his poems has been an inspiration for me. On a personal
basis, his poems have made me a stronger person and have helped me overcome
something which I thought was impossible. He pours his feelings into his poem which
makes it touch your heart and your soul.&lt;br&gt;
-Hamida Abdeali, United Kingdom&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The rhythm in his vibrating voice made me think if only I could just listen to him
reading his poems, the tone sent out the gist of each and every poem; but then I
thought if a book gets published each and every one will fi nd solace in the content of
the book.&lt;br&gt;

  <title>Fuel for Pilgrims (Volume Three) - Stephen John March</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pilgrimage is a very rich metaphor for the Christian life. It evokes much that is foundational for an authentic self-understanding as a disciple of Jesus. Each of these books contains 40 individual meditations that are designed to give pilgrims &#39;fuel&#39; for the journey. These meditations will inspire faith, encourage self-reflection, and help the reader to set their own spiritual life in the context of Christian discipleship down through the millennia. The individual meditations are inspired by an eclectic mix of sources- Scripture, Christian hagiography, Church History, contemporary events, and scientific discovery. Each meditation is accompanied by questions which guide personal meditation, as well as suggestions for a prayer response. Although these books are suitable for private use, it is hoped that groups will use them with private daily use being augmented by group time of sharing and praying together. Suited for Lent/Advent use" />

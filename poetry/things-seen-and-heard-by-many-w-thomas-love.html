  <title>Things Seen and Heard by Many - W. Thomas Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Things Seen and Heard by Many&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poetry based upon the authors observations of people as they go about their daily lives, not knowing they are being observed. Within each observed life is a central problem caused by some outside influence or an internal conflict. Author W. Thomas Love seeks to bring this to light to stimulate all who read the book to examine themselves and their respective lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This examination hopes to minimize the problems before they become uncontrollable. An uncontrolled problem will disrupt life. From the outward expressions of a cotton pickers life and the authors interpretation of his life to the revelation that the world is a hard place that creates hard hearts, the poetry considers the essence of the human soul in its journey through life.&lt;br&gt;
These are many souls we encountered through our walk through this life. &lt;i&gt;Things Seen and Heard by Many&lt;/i&gt; chronicles their joy, pain, struggle, disappointments, and their sadness.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Brother (Dr. Claude)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We want you to know that you, our brother, have been the highlight of our lives&lt;br&gt;
You came from way down under, but you still reached for the sky.&lt;br&gt;
You were born in abject poverty, an environment with defocusing means.&lt;br&gt;
You were the exception to the rule because you had big dreams.&lt;br&gt;
You were a quiet young man with a deep mind&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Adventures of Happy the Flamingo: - Blake, Amy Ozier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a true story about two kids who go on vacation with their family, but dont realize that God has a whole other adventure planned. After much fun at theme parks, hotels, eateries, and more, they happen upon a game where they could win a big, bright, happy, pink and purple flamingo. The boys hopes are so high, but they do not win the flamingo by the rules of the game, but by Gods grace. In the moment the flamingo is given to the boys, their mommy thinks, how will we get this flamingo home? The flamingo, which the boys name Happy, goes everywhere with the Ozier family. Everyone is happy. Then the adventure heats up. Happy must make it home by several modes of transportation: taxi, plane, and more. The boys daddy is not so sure this is possible. But with a plan of prayer and walking by faith, the adventure does continue. Will Happy make it home? Does God really hear our prayers? Find out in The Adventures of Happy the Flamingo: A Childs Walk of Faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Psalm Hymns, Books 1, 2, &amp; 3: Dramatic, Contemplative, Singable, Recitable Psalms! - L. L. Larkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Raw, classic prayers for a creative&amp;#39;s portfolio. Use to perform or study dramatic historical pleas with worship and praises to God. This volume of 89 singable Psalm Hymns guides you through anchored lyrics in dramatic poetry yet, allows you to interpret the intent and style at will. Find here, the first three books of ancient prayers and meditations from the Old Testament. &amp;nbsp;Psalms reflect the many loving-kindnesses of God and also the odd silences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Simply a resource of singable, recitable Psalm lyrics, this modern Psalter is offered to you for teaching music, for student use, and for private practice in dramatic interpretation.&amp;nbsp; The Psalms help&amp;nbsp;us recite dramatic historical pleas as well as&amp;nbsp;the worship and praises of God&amp;#39;s people in&amp;nbsp;singing, drama, and recitation. &amp;quot;The Psalms are prescribed and authorized for worship throughout God&amp;#39;s kingdom, and without them, our worship is censored, uninformed and incomplete.&amp;quot; - Timothy Raymond (editor for Credo Magazine,&amp;nbsp;Indiana)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first three of five volumes of the Davidic Psalms (Hebrew tradition) are set to the rhythm of Christian hymns of the English and American traditions. Use for personal and communal reflection, poetry, and memory work. How would your faith change if you were to sing a psalm a day, evening or morning?&amp;nbsp; How would your community of faith be enriched if you were to include a psalm of historical context, testimony or lament to your services?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Psalms,&amp;quot; in the Hebrew means &amp;quot;Praises.&amp;quot; Let the message about the Messiah dwell richly among you, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude in your hearts to God. Colossians 3:16 (HCSB)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The phrase, &amp;quot;teaching and admonishing&amp;quot;, means there should be a place in our worship centers for historical education of the Psalms, performance, and discussion. Here, they expressly describe the wonders of God during terrifying events, illness, and betrayal, describing also God&amp;rsquo;s splendor in nature. They describe human relationships with God during life&amp;#39;s miracles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;CAPTURE BOOKS&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;https://www.CaptureMeBooks.com&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; https://www.facebook.com/CaptureBooks/&lt;br /&gt; https://www.facebook.com/PsalmHymns.Larkins/&lt;/p&gt;" />

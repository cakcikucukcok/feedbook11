  <title>Church Girl - Anita M. Hoover, Emmanuel Hoover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One foot in the world, the other in church...THE MIND GAME IS TOO MUCH!
Raised in church from her childhood, Anita - like many others - gave in to the pull of peer-pressure.  Included in that downward spiral was an abusive relationship that almost cost her life.  Returning to the only comfort-zone she ever knew - the church, she still struggled to &quot;belong&quot;.  Through many life-altering events, the Lord got Anita&#39;s attention and let her know she had to make up her mind and make a change. Would she live for the Lord, or keep trying to live for herself?  It is Anita&#39;s hope that this true story will sound the alarm to every reader: &quot;IT&#39;S TIME TO CHOOSE WHOM YOU WILL SERVE!&quot;" />

  <title>Welcome to the Light - Karl Krahn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;....If you are happy with the way this world has prepared for the second coming of Christ, fine. Go your merry way and enjoy. I am not, and the results are why you are reading this story. I was raised by a very strong believing Mother. She taught the truth always wins, be sure your sins will find you out and as you sow, so shall you reap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...She didn&#39;t prepare me for this world, but for the next. When I finally understood this, it was too late. I could not believe it was possible to have the Spirit of Jesus Christ enter my heart, mind and soul, and feel no difference. For years I searched for the feeling of total acceptance. I often felt the presence of the Holy Spirit, but it was always in someone else. I could not find the feelings, I was looking for. It&#39;s not possible to list the extent and searching of this journey, but in the end, I gave up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...If there is no God, it makes no difference. If there is a God, and He won&#39;t talk to me, that&#39;s worse. So I quit. The last day, when all living beings go before the final judgment, I have no defense. I believed, by not talking to me, God was not living up to His promise. Then I got very happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...All my worries about Hell&#39;s fury and roasting for the rest of time, vanished. I set a time limit of three weeks and then I was going to stop living. Nothing fancy, I was going to find a simple way to stop living. I rejected this life completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My worries were over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Then, after two weeks, I got an overwhelming desire to get a pencil and paper. The desire was so strong, if I didn&#39;t have paper in time, I would write on table tops or anything that was handy. They were poems. They came pouring from my hand.
They came so fast, there is no way I could tell them that fast.
Now I offer them to those that think there has to be more in this life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...The hope and prayers that we will be covered by His Loving Grace, even though we make no effort to live better, just don&#39;t wash. If you want to live again, you have got to try. I say again.
If you believe you already have a passkey to Heaven, Have a nice day. If these poems can help one person, Praise God !!&lt;/p&gt;" />

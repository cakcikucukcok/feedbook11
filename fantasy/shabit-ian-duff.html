  <title>Shabit - Ian Duff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Ians wife, Jade, is kidnapped during a drive-by shooting as they celebrate their first anniversary, his world changes forever. Twenty years later, there are still questions about her disappearance, and even his career as an independent assassin for the FBI has not brought him closer to solving the mysteryor ease the pain of missing her. Despite the intense focus on his work, he remains haunted by memories and the unknown. Was it a case of mistaken identity, or something more sinister?
Meanwhile, evil flourishes in a world corrupted by sex, greed, and drugs in such exotic settings as Monaco, the Bahamas, and Marbella, where Ian carries out his jobs. But larger forces are at work, and one man, with a plan he has carefully put together over forty-two years, is in his own gruelling fight against time. The outcome sends drug barons spiralling into panic as their fortunes begin to tumble. But the planner himself, in addition to his pawns, is soon endangered, caught up in a game where betrayal and trust are intertwined. Someone is playing cloak-and-dagger and carelessly jeopardizing everything. When, where, and how it all ends becomes the million-dollar question, framed by the chilling words: If I die, the world you know will die with me.
In a tale of intrigue set among Bentleys, yachts, diamonds, and endless cash, people and circumstances arent always what they seem." />

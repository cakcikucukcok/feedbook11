  <title>The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon: The Diary of a Courtesan in Tenth Century Japan - Arthur Waley, Dennis Washburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Japan in the 10th century stood physically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world. Inside this bubble, a subtle and beautiful world was in operation, and its inhabitants were tied to the moment, having no interest in the future and disdain for the past.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon&lt;/I&gt; was a product of a tenth century courtier&#39;s experiences in the palace of Empress Teishi. A common custom of the time period, courtiers used to keep notes or a diary in a wooden pillow with a drawer. This &quot;pillow book&quot; reflects the confident aesthetic judgments of Shonagon and her ability to create prose that crossed into the realm of the poetic. &lt;I&gt;The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon&lt;/I&gt; is one of the earliest examples of diary literature whose passages chronicle the events of the court calendar, the ceremonies and celebrations specific to Teishi&#39;s court, and the vignettes that provide brilliantly drawn glimpses into the manners and foibles of the aristocracy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Arthur Waley&#39;s elegant translation of &lt;I&gt;The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon&lt;/I&gt; captures the beauty of its prose and the vitality of Shonagon&#39;s narrative voice, as well as her quirky personality traits.&lt;/div&gt;" />

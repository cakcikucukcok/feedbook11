  <title>A Collection of Poetry: Matters of the Heart, Revealed - Robin M. Bellamy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So many people have inspired me throughout my lifetime, that most I will remember, and some I might forget, but charge it to my head, not my heart.  First, I would like to thank God for giving me the gift of writing, and blessing me with the opportunity to share my personal thoughts with others, who may be going through similar situations.  Secondly, I would like to thank my parents, biological and surrogates for their continued support throughout the years.  Georgia Bellamy, for giving me life and doing everything in her power to give me happiness.  Orton Bellamy, for being such a great step-dad.  Thanks for your love and support.  Tillmond Williams, for showing me that no matter what curve balls youre thrown in life, you can rise above them.  Mr. Lindbirgh Bellamy, for always loving me, even when I was difficult to love and supporting me to fulfill my dreams.  Dr. James L. Floyd, for literally saving my life, and stepping into a fatherly role.  James and Patricia Livingston for being a great uncle and aunt, and always encouraging me.  Reverend Benjamin F. Powell, and Ms. Lois Powell, for being my spiritual advisors as well as my second parents.  To my sister Marian, I appreciate our relationship now more than ever.  To my two grandmothers, Ms. Clara Bellamy and Ms. Peggy Bellamy for doing the extra things that my parents didnt do, like most grandparents do, to show me your love.  Mr. George Green, for being the best Pop-Pop in the world.  I miss you, but I know youre sleeping with the angels.  To Aunt Ollie, Uncle Melvin, Uncle Paul, Aunt Louise, and Aunt Oleen, thanks for showing me kindness and love." />

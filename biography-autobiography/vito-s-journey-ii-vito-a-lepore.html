  <title>Vito’S Journey Ii - Vito A. Lepore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For author Vito A. Lepore, the years between 1950 and 1959 were the most important of his life. Decisions were made that affected the coming years, and his character became defined. In Vitos Journey II, he picks up where part one of his memoir, Vitos Journey, leaves off but with a different focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first book introduced family members and told stories of a boys transition from Italy to America. Vitos Journey II begins with his first step out into an adult world and journeys through the stages that follow. Told in a series of entertaining vignettes, the stories include: his foray into baseball, the night Nunzio was kidnapped, a taste of the Italian personality, life in the military, a night in jail, and his first full-time adult job. There is also a climactic court sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vitos Journey II, Lepore communicates the lessons he learned throughout his life. Whether its boyhood or adulthood, life is a never-ending series of crossroads, some by accident and some by design. Your life can change on any given day. It then follows that there is no such thing as a last chance, and that failure is part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Fundraising for Volunteers - Brian Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fundraising for Volunteers takes you on a journey through the maze of fundraising concepts, processes, and activities in a simple and easy-to-follow manner. It provides readers with all the skills you will need to select a fundraising event and put into place the planning required to make it highly successful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book deals with the topic in three sections: The Committee, The One Secret Key, and The Event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section One helps with one of the most difficult aspects of fundraising: how to manage and run a fundraising committee. It talks about how to handle many of the common difficulties that arise when working with committees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section Two illuminates a simple and easy-to-implement key to fundraising. There is only one key, and once you know what it is, making money from fundraising will always be assured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section Three includes an extensive list of fundraising events from which to choose your next event. The events are categorized and classified, which makes choosing an appropriate event for your group very easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a must read before you hold your next fundraising activity.&lt;/p&gt;" />

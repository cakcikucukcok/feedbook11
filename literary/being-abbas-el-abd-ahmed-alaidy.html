      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The millennial generation&#39;s most celebrated literary achievement.&quot; Al-Ahram Weekly &quot;The first glimmer of hope for a true fictional renaissance an instantly rewarding read embraced by an unprecedented range of literary figures&quot; The Daily Star &quot;What is madness?&quot; asks the narrator of Ahmed Alaidy&#39;s jittery, funny, and angry novel. Assuring readers that they are about to find out, the narrator takes us on a journey through the insanity of present-day Cairo in and out of minibuses, malls, and crash pads, navigating the city&#39;s pinball machine of social life with tolerable efficiency. But lurking under the rocks in his grouchy, chain-smoking, pharmaceutically-oriented, twenty-something life are characters like his elusive psychiatrist uncle with a disturbing interest in phobias. And then there&#39;s Abbas, the narrator&#39;s best friend who surfaces at critical moments to drive our hero into uncontrollably multiplying difficulties. For instance, theres the ticklish situation with the simultaneous blind-dates Abbas has set up for him on different levels of a coffee-shop in a Cairo mall with two girls both called Hind. With friends like Abbas, what paranoiac needs enemies?" />

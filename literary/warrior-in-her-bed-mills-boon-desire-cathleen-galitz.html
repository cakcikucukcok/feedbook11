          &lt;strong&gt;Annie Wainright hoped teaching on an isolated Native American reservation would bring peace to her troubled soul.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that was before she came face-to-face with the most compelling man she&#39;d ever known - a man who made it clear he didn&#39;t want her there…. John Lonebear, an ex-marine who had returned to make his home a better place, was as harsh and unyielding as the land he loved. And yet even he could not deny the wildfire heat that blazed between him and this unwelcome stranger….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She wanted to believe love could build a bridge between their worlds. But what would happen when he learned about the new life their love had created…?&lt;/p&gt;

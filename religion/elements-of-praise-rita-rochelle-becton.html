  <title>Elements of Praise: - Rita Rochelle Becton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being a Christian is hard. Sometimes it seems we fall down more than we rise up. We carry our cross but, there are days when we lay it down, or worse forget it. We have daily decisions to make, are we ours, or, are we His? Is His love all sufficient to carry us all the way to heaven? Is this faith real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships are the key to life. Many of us spend an enormous amount of time fretting about and trying to foster relationships in our everyday life. Yet, there is one relationship we dont spend enough time cultivating - our relationship with God through the Holy Spirit. In this book there are good days, bad days, moments of joy and sadness and within them all is the Holy Spirit, leading, guiding and creating. He helps us see Christ in every circumstance and situation; bringing us closer to the intangible Christ through the tangible word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elements of Praise&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of discovery. A discovery that we are indeed never alone. Holy Spirit is there with us guiding us to our destiny in Jesus Christ for the glory of God the Father, showing us that faith is, love is, Christ is our central element of praise!&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Esther the Wonder Pig - Steve Jenkins, Derek Walter, Caprice Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlikely pig owners Steve and Derek got a whole lot more than they bargained for when the designer micro piglet they adopted turned out to be a full-sized 600-pound sow! This funny, inspirational story shows how families really do come in all shapes and sizes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the summer of 2012, Steve Jenkins was contacted by an old friend about adopting a micro piglet. Though he knew his partner Derek wouldn&#39;t be enthusiastic, he agreed to take the adorable little pig anyway, thinking he could care for her himself. Little did he know, that decision would change his and Derek&#39;s lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  It turned out there was nothing &quot;micro&quot; about Esther, and Steve and Derek had actually signed on to raise a full-sized commercial pig. Within three years, Tiny Esther grew to a whopping 600 pounds. After some real growing pains and a lot of pig-sized messes, it became clear that Esther needed much more space, so Steve and Derek made another life-changing decision: they bought a farm and opened the Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary, where they could care for Esther and other animals in need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Funny, heartwarming, and utterly charming, &lt;i&gt;Esther the Wonder Pig&lt;/i&gt; follows Steve and Derek&#39;s adventure--from reluctant pig parents to farm-owning advocates for animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;  AMAZON BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR" />

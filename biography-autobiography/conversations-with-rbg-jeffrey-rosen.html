  <title>Conversations with RBG - Jeffrey Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In her own words, Ruth Bader Ginsburg offers an intimate look at her life and career, through an extraordinary series of conversations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; with the head of the National Constitution Center.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This remarkable book presents a unique portrait of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, drawing on more than twenty years of conversations with Jeffrey Rosen, starting in the 1990s and continuing through the Trump era. Rosen, a veteran legal journalist, scholar, and president of the National Constitution Center, shares with us the justice&#39;s observations on a variety of topics, and her intellect, compassion, sense of humor, and humanity shine through. The affection they have for each other as friends is apparent in their banter and in their shared love for the Constitution--and for opera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Conversations with RBG&lt;/i&gt;, Justice Ginsburg discusses the future of &lt;i&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/i&gt;, her favorite dissents, the cases she would most like to see overruled, the #MeToo movement, how to be a good listener, how to lead a productive and compassionate life, and of course the future of the Supreme Court itself. These frank exchanges illuminate the steely determination, self-mastery, and wit that have inspired Americans of all ages to embrace the woman known to all as &quot;Notorious RBG.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever the topic, Justice Ginsburg always has something interesting--and often surprising--to say. And while few of us will ever have the opportunity to chat with her face-to-face, Jeffrey Rosen brings us by her side as never before. &lt;i&gt;Conversations with RBG&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply felt portrait of an American hero.&lt;/p&gt;" />

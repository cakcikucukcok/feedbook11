  <title>Expressing U - Ms. Jeanette Barker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book of poetry is about love, heartaches, honor to those that has pass on. In my life I have endure many heartaches. But I rise above it all. Have you ever had a broken heart and it feels like a knife is in your chest. Its as if you can really feel the pain within your body. You have to go beyond that pain and reach down in your soul for understanding. Then you can heal. I can honest say that a lot of my poetry comes to me in dreams. I often wake up and a poem is in my mind. I go to my pen and paper and write. Sometimes it feels like someone is controlling my thoughts. I can take a statement and run with it without thinking what to write next.
I pray before I write to give someone some comforting words. I often have my moment with God. God is the only one that understands me. When you are sincere and it comes from the heart. God with you 100% with you God knows my heart and the heart of others. Death is not a simple thing to get over. We know that person of love one is not hurting or suffering anymore, but it still hurts. We know that they have move on to a better place, but we still miss. If I can write one word or sentence for someone to feel that they are going to be all right. Then I want to keep writing till I cant write anymore. I want to think till I cant think anymore. I want to feel the love here and beyond. I want to know that Im living for something and someone. To embrace a smile on someone face beyond that pain is all I want to do." />

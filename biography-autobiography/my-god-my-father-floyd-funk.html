  <title>My God My Father - Floyd Funk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From his early childhood, author Floyd Funk was a dreamer and a romantic, wanting the most excitement and fulfillment he could get out of life. In &lt;i&gt;My God/My Father&lt;/i&gt;, he shares forty years of his life story. His memoir recounts his pastoral and bittersweet small-town, Midwestern upbringing culminating in the shocking revelation of his parental abduction at the age of eleven.  From that point his life is irrevocably altered and we follow him on his trial-and-error road of re-unification, both with his family and with his own identity.&lt;p&gt;
Funk shares how his saving grace was his faith in God, the one who helped him conquer his demons and break through the chains that held him down for years. This is Floyds testament to the unyielding presence of God through many years of broken relationships, false starts, and painful self-realization." />

  <title>We Lesser Gods - Elizabeth Clayton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;--Ah, we cannot know, in reality, until the afternoon, how much the
feast has set out for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, We Lesser Gods is a record of a difficult compilation of one life, one self - events, sentiments, ideas -- these formed and being accepted or rejected in their come maturity. Ideas are included at many cognitive levels, toward the consensus, said to be a choice, but a forced choice, involving components of only surmisal, balanced by the forward appendage of thought: hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...I must admit you have a way with words! I found your poetry interesting, and your descriptions very vivid, and with emotion. I thank you very much for sharing your talents with me...best wishes for your continued success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...besides literary gifts you have the gift of thoughtfulness. Thank you so much for sharing your talents and gifts with others...&lt;/p&gt;

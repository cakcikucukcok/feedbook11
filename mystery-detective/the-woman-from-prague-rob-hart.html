  <title>The Woman From Prague - Rob Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Named one of the Best Books of the Summer by &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Named a Hot Summer Read by the &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;div&gt;Amateur private investigator Ash McKenna&#39;s time is about to expire-on his visa, that is. Having fled the demons that haunted him in the U.S., Ash has been laying low in Prague for nearly three months. Now, it&#39;s time to move on. But as he contemplates his next stop, a man named Roman appears, claiming to work for the U.S. government, and possessing intimate knowledge of Ash&#39;s many sins. Sins nobody should know. Roman offers to protect him...in exchange for a favor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It sounds simple: a bank employee named Samantha Sobolik is set to receive a package containing covert information in a handoff on the Charles Bridge. Ash must intercept the package, and deliver the contents to Roman. Ash refuses-until Roman threatens to kill his mother. Out of options and too far away to protect her, Ash agrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But when Ash gets to the bridge, he discovers that the handoff is actually a hit. Ash ends up battling a mysterious and deadly assassin in a fight he barely survives. As it turns out, the job is far more complicated and dangerous than anyone thought. Ash finds himself in a strange city, outmatched, hunted, and trapped in a dangerous game where nobody is what they seem-including Samantha. &lt;i&gt;The Woman From Prague&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting novel of international suspense from one of the very best crime writers working today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

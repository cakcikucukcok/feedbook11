  <title>Nigeria: Leadership and Development - Eme N. Ekekwe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book , NIGERIA: LEADERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT - ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF CHIBUIKE ROTIMI AMAECHI , is an attempt to clarify the issue about leadership and how , in our circumstances , it has impeded ( or for those who believe differently , facilitated ) the achievement of the Nigeria project.
The philosophy behind this book is that if those who are doing well get encouragement they will see the need to remain focussed and stay the course ; they may then inspire others who may aim to achieve even more. It is useful to always be critical in appreciating those who lead because it might help them to improve . But it is most unhelpful to always condemn everything , and thus attracting into the ring those who are entirely shameless. There is something to be gained by encouraging those who show signs of understanding that Nigeria cannot afford to continue muddling through unless it wants to literally fall off the map in a globalized world . Leadership is an honour and an opportunity for service to humanity and not just a platform for self - promotion.

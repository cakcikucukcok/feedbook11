  <title>The Selected Poetry of Lord Byron - Lord George Byron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lord George Gordon Byron was the flamboyant aristrocratic Romantic poet who is as renown for his personal life as he is for his poetry. Lord Byron lived a short life, from 1788 to 1824, but managed to create a volume of poetry that achieved him the status as one of the greatest English poets and is still widely read in the English-speaking world and beyond. This extensive selection includes such classics as &quot;Childe Harold&#39;s Pilgrimage&quot;, a sweeping narrative poem which relays the story of a world-weary young man who abandons a life of pleasure for distraction in foreign lands, and a selection from &quot;Don Juan&quot;, widely considered Byron&#39;s masterpiece which tells the legend of Don Juan as a man who is easily seduced by women instead of the more common womanizing portrayal. Fans of English Romantic poetry would be remiss in skipping this fine collection of over one hundred of Byron&#39;s classic poetic works." />

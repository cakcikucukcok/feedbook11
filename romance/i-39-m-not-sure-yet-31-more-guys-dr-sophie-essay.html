      <meta name="description" content="A San Francisco girl who had a very special life, but she got lost at a certain point. She knew many guys who loved her, put her in funny situations, or took her to exotic places, but she was in a continuous search for the special one. Did she find him in her 31 guys/year? Each guy she met had a close resemblance to a movie star, a sports champ, or a well-known professional. Each guy&#39;s story will come soon! Her luck fluctuated up and down, she never resisted it, mostly embraced it. She believed in fate and destiny. Myra was so smart for her age, with sense of humor and an open heart for everyone around her. She loved people and that was part of her issues. Her dazzling beauty made men go crazy about her, but there were other qualities that some of them were looking for in addition to beauty and brilliance. Her aunt Lydia raised her up very well, being a teacher for long time, but she never got married. Distinctive 31 guys you will get to know soon!" />

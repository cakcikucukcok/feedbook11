  <title>The Tale of a Turtle Who Learned a Good Lesson - William K. Zimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Toby, a box turtle who is always complaining about carrying his heavy shell while admiring the agility of lizards, befriends Lumpy, a toad. Lumpy tries to convince Toby that being a lizard would not be as wonderful as he imagines, but Toby is unconvinced. Even when his shell saves Lumpy from a snake, Toby continues to complain. A crafty vulture takes advantage of the turtle&amp;#39;s discontent and convinces Toby that if he meets the &amp;quot;change monster,&amp;quot; he will be freed from his shell. Lumpy comes to the rescue just in time to push his friend out of the way of an eighteen-wheeler, foiling the vulture&amp;#39;s plan. Lumpy and Toby return home after Toby experiences a bad dream involving the snake. Toby learns to like himself and is grateful for both his friend Lumpy and his shell.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Call With Promise: Receive the Best from God - Richmond Donkor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No matter how old you are, where you&amp;rsquo;re from or what you do for a living, we all share something in common&amp;mdash;a desire to be successful. The question most of us ask ourselves is what can I do to become more successful? How can I excel in all areas of life, whether in your spirituality, family, career, business, and education? We were miss-informed by well-meaning people and institutions that told us that success is hard to come by, a struggle. You probably mistakenly believe that you are not good enough, smart enough, etc. These beliefs are just lies you have told yourself that you have come to believe. The fact is that you have everything you need inside of you right now to become a huge success. The challenge is to excavate your treasure and bring it to the light so that everyone can see and appreciate who you are and what you can do. The treasure that is within you are your God-given gifts, ?as well as having the ability to trust in a higher power ?who wants you to be healthy, wealthy, and wise. There are a lot of steps that you can use to be more successful if we know how to set clear intentions, apply focused attention, and take massive action daily. Always remember the essential Truth that you already have all that you need to attract more success and happiness, you just need to learn to access your inner power. This is what The Call with Promise book is about. Learn secrete you have never heard before in your life to unleash the power within you and build a successful life that you deserve. These truths have changed my life and I strongly believe that it will open your inner eyes and ears for you to build a huge success in all aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

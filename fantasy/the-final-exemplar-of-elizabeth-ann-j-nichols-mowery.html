  <title>The Final Exemplar of Elizabeth Ann - J. Nichols Mowery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For two years, Liz, Beth, and Ann have shared the cabin that their father built on Redcliffs Beach. This particular June first, each accepts they were once the same small child, named Elizabeth Ann Anderson, and are currently living parallel lives. Now family, the three women meet daily at the golden stone placed in the cabins floor when it was constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the stone, they share their days adventures, interesting encounters, and frightening confrontations. They come to recognize that the animals in their lives are actually animal-familiars, sent to lead them through unknown dimensions and out to the edge of the universe. Following this revelation, the golden stone sends them a life-altering message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each incarnation of Elizabeth Ann must prepare for the summer solstice. If all goes to plan, they will be inside the cliffs crystal cave before sunrise with their animal-familiars. Messages from the golden stones must be obeyed, and each woman promises to do so, unaware that on the solstice, one will be taken, one will be released, and one will be returned to what once was.&lt;/p&gt;" />

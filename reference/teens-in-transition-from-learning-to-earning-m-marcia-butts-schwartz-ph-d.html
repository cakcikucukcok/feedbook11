  <title>Teens in Transition from Learning to Earning - M. Marcia Butts-Schwartz Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The writer has determined through her needs assessment that one of the greatest needs in Philadelphia today is a job readiness program for teenagers. By most measures, teenagers have a difficult time in the labor force. Specifically, their unemployment rate is the highest of all the age groups. The types of jobs they hold have limited prospects, and their wages are low. The group most in need of help is minority female teens, and one of the area most in need is West Philadelphia. Therefore, the writer, with the help of an advisory committee and with the cooperation of the school principal, Dr. Davis Martin, completed plans for such a program. The job readiness program was presented at the University City High School to a group of minority teens. The various phases of the program were presented by the writer and other professionals. These young people from the West Philadelphia Community received great benefit from this project. It is the writers hope that the results of this social action will be of help to other areas of the city. The writer hopes also that this program may eventually become city wide." />

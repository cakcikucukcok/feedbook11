      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;center&gt;Love and Shadows&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rugged and strong, Chance McCall was an awakening, a mystery, a dream -- and Jennifer Ann Tyler loved him from the moment he hired on at the Triple T Ranch. Through the passing years he has always kept his distance, afraid that his checkered history and uncertain future destroyed any chance for happiness with the boss&amp;#8217;s beautiful daughter. Now a tragic accident has robbed Chance of his memory -- and he must leave the ranch to retrieve his lost past. But Jenny knows her heart will never be full if she lets the only man she has ever wanted vanish from her life. And until he can find himself, Jenny will follow Chance McCall anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;" />

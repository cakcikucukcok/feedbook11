  <title>Lessons from a Dark Time and Other Essays - Adam Hochschild</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Around the world, many a country that was once a democracy, or seemed on the path to being so, has turned towards repression. From Poland to the Philippines, Hungary to India, Turkey to Russia, autocrats with little tolerance for dissent are riding high.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Lessons from a Dark Time and Other Essays &lt;/I&gt;collects some two-dozen pieces published over the past 25 years from bestselling author Adam Hochschild. Hochschild traverses throughout Africa, India, Europe, and America and shares the forces that have prevented us, today or in centuries past, from living in a fairer and more humane world. He takes us from a prison in Finland, to descendants of slaves gathering in a London park, to a day on the campaign trail with Nelson Mandela. He shares the stories of environmentally pioneering architect Laurie Baker,&amp;#160; the &lt;I&gt;gulag &lt;/I&gt;survivor Nadezhda Joffe, and&amp;mdash;dying much too young of a heart attack while weakened by malaria&amp;mdash;the brave Congolese crusader against rape, Masika Katsuva.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; With the impartial tone of a journalist but with the obvious heart of an activist, Hochschild shares the stories of people who took a stand against despotism, spoke out against unjust wars, and dared to eradicate the evils of institutions around them, all with the hope of working towards a more connected global community.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;" />

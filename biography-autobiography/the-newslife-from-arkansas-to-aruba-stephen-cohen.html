At every outpost a collection of hard working, young journalists about to be stars, and factors in television news emerge. Their names fast becoming household names. What were they like, when they were full of hope, and the art of doing television news was emerging in full form. And what was the cost of it all, as they burned their images into Americas psyche? And what was the Newslife like for the author , who saw it all, did it all, and emerged to tell this tale?&lt;/p&gt;" />

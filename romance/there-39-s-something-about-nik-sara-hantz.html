  <title>There&#39;s Something About Nik - Sara Hantz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nik Gustafsson has a secret: He&#39;s not really Nik Gustafsson. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;s not a spy. He&#39;s not crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;s just the son and heir to one of the most important families in Europe--one where duty always comes first. And his posh, too-public life is suffocating him. So when he gets the chance to attend boarding school in America, pretending to be an average exchange student is too big of a temptation to pass up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he literally runs into Amber on campus. And she hates him at first sight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s kind of exhilarating to be hated for who he is, not for his family name or his wealth. Maybe if he turns up the charm and turns down the aloof mask he habitually wears, he can win her over. Even though a bad past experience has made her swear off dating this year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the more he gets to know her, the more uncomfortable he is keeping things from her. Because Nik Gustafsson has a secret. And it&#39;s a big one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains a hot boy who&#39;s the strong and silent type, a studious girl who refuses to believe in fairy-tale romance, and one epic secret that could be disastrous if it comes to light.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

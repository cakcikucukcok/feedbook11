  <title>Of Bonds and Bondage - Rita Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Of Bonds and Bondage is a gripping tale filled with mystery, love, sex, hate and revenge.
When Archie Bingham, an assistant District Attorney in New York and son of Sir Archibald Bingham, an eminent British barrister, tries to blackmail Joseph Bocacci into revealing information about certain members of the Mafia, Joseph enlists his adopted grandson, Frankie Leeman, to look into Binghams background.
In Part One, Leemans mission takes him to London, England, where he learns what effect Bingham had on the lives of the people who loved or trusted him, uncovering the shocking tale of a man seemingly possessed by the devil. Leeman is drawn into a bittersweet love affair although he knows his heart will be broken, and comes to learn about his own mysterious roots and Joseph Bocaccis connection to the death of his parents in Italy.
In Part Two, the reader learns Binghams version of everything that took place in his life before he emigrated to Americahis betrayals, seductions, sins and lies. The reader learns the reasons for his actions and for his bitter relationship with his father.
The author then weaves these two narrative strands back together, bringing her story to a shocking, touching and ultimately satisfying conclusion." />

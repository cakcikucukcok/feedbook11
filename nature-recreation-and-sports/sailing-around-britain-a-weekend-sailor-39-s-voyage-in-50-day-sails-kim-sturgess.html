  <title>Sailing Around Britain: A Weekend Sailor&#39;s Voyage in 50 Day Sails - Kim Sturgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN STYLE= &quot;&quot; &gt;Kim Sturgess was a weekend sailor: he enjoyed club racing and several brief sailing holidays, but had never attempted a substantial expedition. Reaching the age of fifty focused the mind and he decided to sail around Britain. &lt;BR&gt;While many cruising sailors would not contemplate a 1900 nautical mile voyage, he broke the voyage into a series of day sails, making it an achievable ambition for him, largely single-handed, and for many other weekend sailors who might dream of sailing around their home island. &lt;BR&gt;This book tells the quirky traveller&amp;rsquo;s narrative of the voyage and visits to forty-eight towns. Evoking the spirit of both Jerome K. Jerome with his Three Men in a Boat and Joshua Slocum&amp;rsquo;s Sailing Alone Around the World, Kim shares his thoughts and struggles, recounting how easy it is for anyone to become an adventurer here at home.&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />

  <title>Stick Out Your Tongue - Ma Jian, Flora Drew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tibet is a land lost in the glare of politics and romanticism, and Ma Jian set out to discover its truths. &lt;i&gt;Stick Out Your Tongue &lt;/i&gt;is a revelation: a startlingly vivid portrait of Tibet, both enchanting and horrifying, beautiful and violent, seductive and perverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this profound work of fiction, a Chinese writer whose marriage has fallen apart travels to Tibet. As he wanders through the countryside, he witnesses the sky burial of a Tibetan woman who died during childbirth, shares a tent with a nomad who is walking to a sacred mountain to seek forgiveness for sleeping with his daughter, meets a silversmith who has hung the wind-dried corpse of his lover on the wall of his cave, and hears the story of a young female incarnate lama who died during a Buddhist initiation rite. In the thin air of the high plateau, the divide between dream and reality becomes confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this book was published in Chinese in 1997, the government accused Ma Jian of &quot;harming the fraternal solidarity of the national minorities,&quot; and a blanket ban was placed on his future work. With its publication in English, including a new afterword by the author that sets the book in its personal and political context, readers get a rare glimpse of Tibet through Chinese eyes--and a window on the imagination of one of China&#39;s foremost writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

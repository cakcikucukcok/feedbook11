      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;On a world known as Guiya, the Elfin kingdom of Valkhara is theatened by a dark and evil force. 
&lt;P&gt;Deschardon, the deathlord, unleashes his army of Gorg upon the lands of Guiya in hope to make the world his sole empire. His force is led by his five inspirited generals, the Shaynelords and is followed by a dark and menacing cloud that stretches over the conquered nations, signifying the deathlord&#39;s rule over them.
&lt;P&gt;One being has the strength to stand against him; prophesied to be exiled from Valkhara, only to return and save it. Known as the Godchilde, this champion trains with the Elfin priests to master the martial art, Kayata and to command the empowering life force, called the Kiy. With these skills and the mightly blade, Godspel, she may succeed in destroying Deschardon and bringing peace to Valkhara once again." />

  <title>The Un-Suspecting Husband To-Be - T. E. Henry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles Landson, an architect and president of his own company is finding it difficult to design his own life. He becomes flustered by the sudden reappearance of Diana, his first love. His life is thrown into a whirlpool of confusion, out of which he eventually finds his one true love.
Dianas Heart is filled with determination, for she has only one goal, to gain Charless love. She is fearful of her deceit, if immaturely brought to light all her hopes of regaining Charles would be gone. Blinded by lust, but lead by love Diana has return to Charles after months of no communication.  She loved him and he had promised to love her, surely they were meant to be together.
Tallya finds that love isnt all its made out to be. She has lost her heart to a man she had deemed perfect. Only to find her perfect man was not so perfect.  She finds love and affection in another mans arms, only to return to Charles the man she loved, and the man who had promised to be there for her, surely he would be there for her." />

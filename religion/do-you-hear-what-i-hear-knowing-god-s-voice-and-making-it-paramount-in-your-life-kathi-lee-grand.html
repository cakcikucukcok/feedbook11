  <title>Do You Hear What I Hear? Knowing God’S Voice and Making It Paramount in Your Life - Kathi Lee Grand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sounds are all around ustraffic, sirens, noise. But do you hear the whispers, the sounds only God can create? Do you listen, do you hear? In your heart, God can speak to you. He can strengthen you by giving you grace to make a difference in this busy, noisy world. It is through the Holy Spirit, Gods voice within us, that allows us to be a witness for His Kingdom. Are you ready, what do you hear? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youre invited to join Kathi Lee Grand as she shares her journey, the one shes experienced with God since 2000. This includes her spiritual encounters, when she first began to hear the Holy Spirit through that still, small voice. To date she has received thirteen God-inspired words. Each of these words is introduced in a chapter along with the acronym and referenced Scripture verses. Kathi Lee both encourages and challenges readers to explore their own journey as they too seek to hear Gods voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God richly bless you, as you begin your journey with Him as you also experience His voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />

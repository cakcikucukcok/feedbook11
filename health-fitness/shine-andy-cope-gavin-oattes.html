  <title>Shine - Andy Cope, Gavin Oattes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start living the life you’ve always wanted&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could be that you’ve figured everything out on your own and have ended up acing your career, meeting and marrying your perfect partner, producing three wonderful kids, owning a holiday home in Mustique and having a drop-dead gorgeous life. In which case, we applaud you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you need the cheat codes, then this book will give you a nudge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Redefining the genre of ‘self-help comedy,’ &lt;i&gt;Shine&lt;/i&gt; is a book about the brevity of life. It contains adult themes of mortality, change, exhaustion and unrelenting pressure. Thankfully, the bleakness is done with humour and the solutions are entertaining, do-able and uplifting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shine&lt;/i&gt; is the literary equivalent of ‘ctrl/alt/delete.’ All you have to do is read the book, keep an open mind, and apply the learning. You will experience a personal re-boot with new mental software installed, upgrading you to ‘best possible self.’ It’s a very simple process that also happens to be ‘not very easy.’ Because, of course, if being your best self was easy, everybody would be doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average lifespan is 4000 weeks. Look around and you’ll see too many people having a ‘near life experience.’ They’re alive, but not living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Truth time: life’s a short and precious gift that’s hurtling by in a blur. If you want to make a dent in the universe, it’s time to wake up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We figure that if you’re going to rise, you may as well shine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laugh and learn while you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rediscover your ability to ping out of bed every single day with fire in your belly and a smile on your face.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify what really matters in your life and how to stop stressing about the stuff that doesn&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Remember how to focus on all that makes you happy and cut the nonsense that worries you for no reason.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Give up your low-level grumbling and experience the joy that comes when you focus on achieving all that you&#39;ve ever wanted.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find out just how easy it is boost your energy and increase your motivation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover how to break free from &#39;ordinary&#39; and embrace a life of &#39;extraordinary.’&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to channel your inner Mary Poppins.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;" />

  <title>Yellow Face (TCG Edition) - David Henry Hwang, Frank Rich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A pungent play of ideas with a big heart. &lt;I&gt;Yellow Face&lt;/I&gt; brings to the national discussion about race a sense of humor a mile wide, an even-handed treatment and a hopeful, healing vision of a world that could be.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Variety&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Charming, touching, and cunningly organized as well as funny, [with] an Ibsenite reach and stature far beyond any issues of Hwang&amp;rsquo;s self-image.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about our country, about public image, about &lt;I&gt;face&lt;/I&gt;,&amp;rdquo; says David Henry Hwang about his latest work, a mock documentary that puts Hwang himself center stage as it explores both Asian identity as well as race in America. The play begins with the 1990s controversy over color-blind casting for &lt;I&gt;Miss Saigon&lt;/I&gt;, before it spins into a comic fantasy, in which the character DHH pens a play in protest and then unwittingly casts a white actor as the Asian lead. &lt;I&gt;Yellow Face&lt;/I&gt; also explores the real-life investigation of Hwang&amp;rsquo;s father, the first Asian American to own a federally chartered bank, and the espionage charges against physicist Wen Ho Lee. Adroitly combining the light touch of comedy with weighty political and emotional issues, &amp;ldquo;Hwang&amp;rsquo;s lively and provocative cultural self-portrait lets nobody off the hook&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;The New York Times&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;David Henry Hwang&lt;/B&gt; is the author of the Tony Award&amp;ndash;winning &lt;I&gt;M. Butterfly&lt;/I&gt;, a finalist for the 1988 Pulitzer Prize. Other plays include &lt;I&gt;Golden Child&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;FOB&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;The Dance and the Railroad&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;Family Devotions&lt;/I&gt;; his opera libretti include three works for composer Philip Glass. He was appointed by President Clinton to the President&amp;rsquo;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

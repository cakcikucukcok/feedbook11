  <title>Am I My Brother’S Keeper? - Andrew Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are we responsible for the well-being of our neighbors and our friends and family?
Obeying the command of God is detrimental in our efforts to reap, eternal life. I have attempted to share my efforts from personal experiences through the power of the Holy Spirit guiding my actions. The Psalm, in 37:25, says, I have been young, and now am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his descendants begging bread (NKJV).
The author, Andrew Earl Stafford, took years to chronicle his experiences for over seventy years as he interprets how the Holy Spirit guided him to be a leader to his family, community, and nation in sharing the presence of God in our everyday lives.
Andrew became aware of the presence of God at an early age as he observed how God protected and provided for his mother, Maezell, who in the 1940s, turned down welfare because she viewed it as a trap to create dependence, rather than an opportunity to succeed. Four boys and one girl to raise, Maezell was told by the welfare department that she could not own a car because it was considered a luxury. Well, Maezells response was that, she needed a car to transport her children to school, besides, she worked at a laundry until she retired. 
Their father, Clifford, after leaving the navy, had no choice but to try and earn a living playing baseball in the, Old Negro Baseball Leagues. His absence from the family created a situation of divorce. Though they face possible economic challenges, Maezells goal was to make sure all of her children finished high school. They all did, and most with honors and all with perfect attendances.
Andrews book covers his struggles in poverty, racism, family, society, and in the realm of spiritual warfare. Although you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, theres no reason to fear evil.
Andrew learned firsthand how God will empower each of us to make this world a better place to live if we are willing to wait on him." />

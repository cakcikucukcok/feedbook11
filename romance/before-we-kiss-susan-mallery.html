Still, the gorgeous brunette at the bar in Fool&#39;s Gold looks harmless&amp;#151;until she takes him home and he discovers a room devoted to securing a man, for life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Dellina Hopkins never guessed that storing gowns from a friend&#39;s bridal boutique would chase away her first and only fling. After her parents died, she skipped her &amp;#34;wild youth&amp;#34; to raise her sisters.

As long hours lead to late nights, the two succumb to temptation again. Has Sam&#39;s luck finally changed? Or this time, will Dellina be the one to run?" />

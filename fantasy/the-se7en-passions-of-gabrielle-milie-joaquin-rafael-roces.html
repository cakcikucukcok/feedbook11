  <title>The Se7en Passions of Gabrielle Émilie - Joaquin Rafael Roces</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gabrielle ilie is a young princess-bride on the eve of her fairy tale wedding. This
should be by all accounts her Happily ever after ending: a royal wedding with
her Prince Charming; but she is hunted with uncertainty and doubt. Although
her mother tries to assure the young princess, she decides impulsively to flee
the safe confines of her castle to follow a mysterious voice that leads her to
the dark woods on the frontiers of her kingdom. She is seduced by the rogue
highwayman, and the two embark on a worldwide journey that takes them
across continents and oceans to the rim of the world. She begins her journey
as a young sheltered and cloistered princess armed with only her knowledge
and education, both of which are benefits of her privileged status. She acts
on impulse and gives very little thought to the consequences that spring
from her decisions. But the veil of Gabrielle iles youthful romance with her
highwayman starts to fade as she examines the true nature of her relationships,
religion, sexuality and identity. She traverses the Silk Road; forges primordial
forests and battles both men and fantastic beasts; she scales the Himalayas and
explores the Amazon; and along the way she discovers the true meaning of
love and faith. Each book chronicles her spiritual and physical journey as she
travels to exotic and distant lands, and learns about love, faith and loyalty and
the true fragile nature of her own humanity." />

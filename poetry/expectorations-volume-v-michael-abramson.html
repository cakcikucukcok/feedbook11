  <title>Expectorations Volume V - Michael Abramson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Abramson is a collector of words and thoughts and unique objects of art and 
old stained glass. As a detailed stained glass window reveals a myriad of changing 
colors and images of light, so changes the meaning of this authors thoughts and 
words whether serious or humorous. He is a simple person; a physician, and a teacher, who 
has spent most of his life showing compassion for others. He has a deep respect for 
women and knows as much as anyone could about them, (often reflected in his poetry), 
yet he is the first to admit that no one will ever completely discover what drives such 
beautiful and complex beings. His views are indeed his poetic reflections as seen through 
some sort of colored but very wonderful light. 
He is a raconteur, a person of integrity and a portrait of an artist perhaps, (perhaps not), but for sure a portrait of a kind unassuming and 
humble man, willing to share his humor, knowledge and love with others. This volume contains more spitting images by author Michael Abramson, which are exhibited masterfully through his quotations, poetry, and free associated rambles in this much larger fifth volume of his work containing well over 850 pieces, including some of his best words from the other volumes. They will make you think, make you laugh, and maybe even make you cry. It contains stories, thoughts; humor, truths and sometimes just words which if read carefully might give you insight into the life and the mind of this clever and sensitive author." />

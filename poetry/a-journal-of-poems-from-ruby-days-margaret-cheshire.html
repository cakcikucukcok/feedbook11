  <title>A Journal of Poems from Ruby Days - Margaret Cheshire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduction
For some people, there will be an instant meaning in many of my sentences.
I hope that throughout my book, many readers will be able to relate to each passion I have personally encountered, moments of joy, true passions of love, where hate has a very fine line, wrapped up in great distinctions hanging between the very depth of love and hate itself, blind, with so many strong emotions, on just one thought. In my case, I have been there many times, each one different from the last, never knowing on that first impact to which side your emotions will rest on.
Part of us never want to believe we could ever lose someone so close to us, our whole being aches with so much grief and despair, you never want to feel anything again; but emotions are there! Each one of us feel all these emotions in a different way.
For me, that sudden impact of emotions flow through my body, racing through each part of me. Feelings that are wrwpped up in mixed emotion; that is when I need to set all these emotions on paper. Into verses of poems, in writings, words, simple, but describing each emotion perfectly the way I feel, so imprinted in my thoughts, hoping to feel some release.
Those that will read my words will understand the many impacts emotions has had in much of my life.
I would like to share these feelings and thoughts in hope that in some way, you can relate to that experience of true emotions of mind, heart, and soul. In an understanding of true life.
Sharing those thoughts with someone, the ones we all keep close to our hearts, possibly never, put them out in the open.
I for one believe each emotion we encounter is a heartfelt impression of who we are!
In return, the person you become . . .
By believing in yourself!
Just emotions on paper." />

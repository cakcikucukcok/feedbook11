  <title>The Birthing of a Glorious Church - Yinka Oloyede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;The birthing of a Glorious church&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Have you ever asked yourself why you were you born and what your purpose on earth is? Most of the time, Christians live a religious life rather than the one that God has destined for them. God is sending out a message that we must all first recognize our role as priests in His kingdom by declaring and revealing who He is when we walk in what He has destined and purposed for our lives. This will give us a real indication of our identity in His kingdom. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book explains why the CHURCH of JESUS CHRIST must refocus on His coming. These days the trend of events stated in Mathew chapter 24 and the headline news are so obvious that we must be on our watch for His coming &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book is to prepare the believers in expectation of the second coming of Jesus Christ for His true saints. It is also to prepare the church as a whole body as Christ&#39;s bride, by washing the spots and wrinkles off her wedding gown to become the glorious bride that Jesus has destined her to be. Her glory will be the light to the world to draw many to Christ from this world of sin.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book has been described as a Christian&#39;s manual of faith for righteous living.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;As an end time messenger of God, Yinka writes with urgency and of necessity for the church of Jesus Christ to prepare for His coming and live in expectancy that He can come anytime soon. She also interprets God&#39;s Word with a divine revelation gifted to her by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;She urges non-believers and those who are searching for the true way to the Supreme God of the universe to receive Jesus the only begotten Son of God as the truth, the life and only way to the Father.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Finally, this book expresses God&#39;s love and compassion for those who have lost hope in this life and to those who have backslidden into the world. Jesus is calling out to you. This is a last call!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It ends with a question: If Jesus comes back today are you ready to go with Him?&lt;/P&gt;" />

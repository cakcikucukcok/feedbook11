  <title>The Third Book of Aphorisms - Nathan Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have made it to the back cover of this book and are probably weighing your options, questioning whether indulging in the contents of these pages will be worth the distinctively pretentious act of purchasing a book of aphorisms. Allow the first humble opinion you encounter regarding this book shed some light on your indecision.
 While many books, especially those which dabble in philosophy, take an excessive amount of time to tell the truth our heroic author has chosen to save you some time and write it all in a short and direct format. This critique of contemporary society skims ideas ranging from religion to sex to taxonomy that will thrill, sadden, infuriate, and perhaps even violate your intellect and emotions, or create some odd combination of the same.  However, these aphorisms, given due consideration, will eventually stir you toward an open and contemplative state to the tune of a few hopeful notes. Or not. There is only one way to find out for sure. If you are smart enough to discover its secrets then you will indulge in the guiding thoughts this book presents as the author has seasoned them with just a hint of misdirection to add some intrigue for you and your admirably keen intellect. Enjoy!" />

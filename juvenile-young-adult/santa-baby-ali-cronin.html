      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snowy days and steamy nights ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;A saucy Christmas novella to heat up your winter nights! &lt;/i&gt;    It&#39;s Christmas, and also the end of Annie&#39;s first few weeks as a chalet girl up in the Swiss mountains. Her boyfriend back home has gone off travelling, and Annie&#39;s not exactly feeling full of festive spirit. She really isn&#39;t in the mood for the stag party of posh-boys who&#39;ve just arrived...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  And sure enough, it isn&#39;t long before one of the party - alpha male George - is coming on a little too strong, and making it clear he&#39;d relish getting Annie under the mistletoe, and into his bed.   She&#39;s almost tempted. George is funny, in a loud, arrogant kind of way, and he&#39;s certainly attractive. But Annie is more interested in someone else... the shy, quiet one of the group, who doesn&#39;t quite seem to fit in with the rest of the public school boys. Pity he&#39;s got a girlfriend -  according to George, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  But the days roll on, and despite the freezing temperatures on the slopes, it&#39;s hotting up in the chalet, and Annie is close to boiling point. The question is, does a certain person feel the same way...   SANTA BABY is part of Hot Key Books&#39; exclusive new novella list, and one of a series of five available this Christmas.

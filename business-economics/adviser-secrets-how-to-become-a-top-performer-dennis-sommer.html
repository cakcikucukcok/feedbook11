  <title>Adviser Secrets How to Become a Top Performer - Dennis Sommer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In today&#39;s fast paced changing business world, professionals must work smarter than ever to improve their performance. What worked in the past doesn&#39;t work today. Clients are more knowledgeable and demanding. Competitors are more aggressive and cutthroat. Technical mastery of your vocation will only take you as far as an &quot;average&quot; performer.&lt;P&gt;
Within the pages of this book, the author reveals a revolutionary approach called the &quot;Adviser Success Model&quot; and walks the reader step-by-step through 13 of the most important communication skills used by top performers.&lt;br&gt;
As a top performer you will:&lt;br&gt;
 earn more money;
get that new job or promotion;
increase your client base;
close more deals;
increase your gross sales revenue;
improve your profit margin;
retain clients for life;
and much more.&lt;P&gt;
This book is intended for business owners, consultants, sales and service professionals who serve clients on a daily basis. Traditionally these are outside clients (sometimes they may be referred to as customers in your organization). Recently Ive also found tremendous success implementing the art of client communication with professionals working with internal clients, that is those professionals who provide services for others within the same organization.&lt;P&gt;
It doesnt matter where you fit in the above description.  The tips and techniques I provide will help you become a master communicator and top performer in your profession. I will focus on the most critical communication skill areas and provide you with successfully proven  techniques. This book will cover:&lt;P&gt;
Questioning  How to ask powerful, smart and insightful questions
Listening  How to become an effective listener
Objection Handling  How to eliminate client objections and resistance
Preparing A Presentation  How to inspire and motivate an audience
Delivering A Presentation  How to persuade your client to your recommendations
Planning A Meeting  How to plan the most effective meeting
Facilitating A Meeting  How to run the most effective meeting
Words and Stories  How to use words and stories to get your point across
The Written Word  How to utilize the most overlooked written communication
Memos And Reports  How to develop powerful reports and memos
Gatekeeper Barriers  How to get client gatekeepers to help you win
Self Promotion  How to promote yourself to the top of your profession
Household Name  How you can become a household name in your industry&lt;P&gt;
Although there have been books published on many of these topics in the past, this book contains new approaches that focus on the critical client and business challenges you are facing today. The primary goal and objective of this program is to help you build your foundation for becoming a top performer in your profession." />

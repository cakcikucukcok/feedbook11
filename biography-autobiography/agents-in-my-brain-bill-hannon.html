  <title>Agents in My Brain - Bill Hannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Agents in My Brain&lt;/i&gt; gives vivid descriptions of the grandiose delusions and paranoid delusions that type-one manic depressives get. It also shows that when you get the right medication and some talk therapy, you can recover. &lt;p&gt;
Bill Hannon has led support groups for the Depression &amp; Bipolar Support Alliance since 1987. He is a guest lecturer in college psychology classes. Bill now lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.&lt;p&gt;
Bipolar disorders directly affect over 2.5% of the US population, and indirectly affect many more friends and family members. Bill Hannon has written a moving and gritty first-hand account of Bipolar I disorder. He describes its effects, how treatment works, and insights into why treatment sometimes doesnt work. He explores in great detail his experiences with delusional thinking as part of a years-long story of recovery and perseverance. Recommended to those patients, family and friends looking to understand themselves and others with affective disorders. This book is also prescribed for professionals seeking to better appreciate what their patients experience outside (or inside) the office walls.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Warren Pendergast M.D.&lt;/b&gt; Medical Director Emeritus. NC Physicians Health Program&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Agents in My Brain&lt;/i&gt; offers an extremely interesting and painful glimpse into the mind of an individual suffering from manic depressive illnessAs a professor of psychology who teaches a course on the psychobiology of mental disorders, I am always on the lookout for books that provide first-hand accounts of mental dysfunction. This one fills a void in my reading list.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Lawrence Wichlinski Ph.D.&lt;/b&gt; Professor of Psychology, Carleton College&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Agents in My Brain&lt;/i&gt;, Bill tells the story of his struggle to find the right combination of medical professionals, medications, and support systems to understand and to manage his bipolar behavior. The journey was difficult, confusing, and often overwhelming. Yet Bill survived AND thrived! An inspirational story, &lt;i&gt;Agents in My Brain&lt;/i&gt; is a testament to the spirit to overcome within each of us. I thank Bill for having the courage to share his life experiences with those of us who continue to search for the total cure. (Bills regular closing comment in our bi-monthly support groups).&lt;br&gt;

  <title>Love Hates - Retta Morgan, Kris Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well Before I could move he was kissing me. I gasped from the suddenness and the shock. I could not believe that he was being so bold. I always thought he was too afraid of my father to do something like that. The feel of his lips wasnt that comfortable but they were really warm. When he did pull away, I did not know what to say. The silence seemed to go on forever.
I am sorry Ellen I wanted to do that yesterday but
Jack, I know that you are trying to make this work, I really do. Its just that I am not ready for a relationship right now.  I am not trying to be rude but I would like it a lot better if we could just be friends.
Again he was silent. He would not even look at me. His face turned from a nice blush to a dark crimson. He was very tense. His hands were balled up and the vein in his neck was bulging. His eyes even looked like they were almost closed. And then it happened; he blew up like a balloon.
I CANT BELIEVE YOU! YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THIS TIME YOU HAVENT HAD ANY FEELING FOR ME! YOURE PLAYING THIS SWEET AND INNOCENT LITTLE GAME AND IM SUPPOSE TO SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR YOU TO COME TO YOUR SENSES? WELL I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU! IM DONE WITH YOU! He left me shaking in fear." />

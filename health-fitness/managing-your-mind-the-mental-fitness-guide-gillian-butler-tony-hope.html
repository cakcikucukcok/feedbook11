  <title>Managing Your Mind: The Mental Fitness Guide - Gillian Butler, Tony Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Originally published in 1995, the first edition of Managing Your Mind  established a unique place in the self-help book market.  A blend of tried-and-true psychological counseling and no-nonsense management advice grounded in the principles of CBTand other psychological treatments, the book straddled two types of self-help literature, arguing that in ones personal and professional life, the way to success is the same.  By adopting the practical strategies that mental health experts Butler and Hope have developed over years of clinical research and practice, one can develop the mental fitness necessary to resolve ones personal and interpersonal challenges at home and work and to live a productive, satisfying life.   The first edition addressed how to develop key skills to mental fitness (e.g., managing ones time better, facing and solving problems better, keeping things in perspective, learning to relax, etc.), how to improve ones relationships, how to beat anxiety and depression, and how to establish a good mind-body balance. For this new edition, Butler and Hope have updated all preexisting material and have added five new chapters-on sexuality and intimate relationships; anger in relationships; recent traumatic events and their aftermath; loss and bereavement; and dealing with the past." />

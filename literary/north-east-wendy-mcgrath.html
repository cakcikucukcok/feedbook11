  <title>North East - Wendy McGrath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;North East&lt;/i&gt;, Wendy McGrath expands on the story she began with &lt;i&gt;Santa Rosa&lt;/i&gt;, as a working class couple living in 1960s Edmonton drift further apart while their young daughter tries to understand subtle shifts she senses taking place under the surface of her family and her neighbourhood. A visit to her grandparents&#39; farm in the country reveals the abject poverty the couple came to the city to escape, and the internecine marital strife that threatens to be born anew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGrath&#39;s crystalline, evocative prose conjures an image of the past that defies nostalgia, conjuring images of a city that is in the midst of rewriting its own history. Through the all-seeing eyes of her child protagonist McGrath conjures indelible scenes of harsh domesticity and small victories, of endless summertime days spent around the home and evenings at the drive-in theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;North East&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The interplay between form and content is masterful.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Rona Altrows, &lt;i&gt;Alberta Views&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[e]ven as the memory of Santa Rosa seems at risk of disappearing from the city&#39;s consciousness entirely, McGrath&#39;s fiction provides a bolt of hope. Her trilogy, once complete, may be the most visible and lasting tribute this neighbourhood has left.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Michael Hingston, &lt;i&gt;Edmonton Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;... crystalline moments of poetic clarity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Jade Colbert, &lt;i&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

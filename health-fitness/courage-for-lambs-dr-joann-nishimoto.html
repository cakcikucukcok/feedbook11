  <title>Courage for Lambs - Dr. JoAnn Nishimoto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All of us are touched by injustice.&lt;br /&gt;
 All of us suffer loss.&lt;br /&gt; 
We are all in recovery from something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this extraordinary memoir of entrapment in an abusive relationship, the dynamics that held her there, and the struggle to recover an authentic life, Dr. JoAnn Nishimoto shares her poignant story of transformation from shame to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with a family members chemical dependency, the suicide of a loved one, and her own spiritual disillusionment, Dr. Nishimotos commitment to recovery served as the foundation for her future ministry and career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nishimoto is a courageous teacher for anyone in recovery from abuse, addiction, or a life-dominating problem. With particular sensitivity to women harmed by pathological men, she provides practical help in overcoming abuse, self-hatred, fear, and shame. Concluding with fourteen essays, her memoir encourages us to courageously press on to freedom, whatever our own story may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JoAnn Nishimoto, PsyD (pictured with Sadie) is a psychologist in Mundelein, Illinois&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JoAnn Nishimoto explores the messiness of living authentically in a broken world, venturing boldly into the difficult topics of abuse, addiction, and death. Her tale is as compelling and spell-binding as any fiction, and yet it is her true story, masterfully crafted and filled with redemption.&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Mark R. McMinn, psychologist, professor, George Fox University; &lt;br /&gt;
author of &lt;em&gt;Finding Our Way Home&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book of hope, because the author has experienced the reality of light overcoming 
darkness and truth destroying lies. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Sandra D. Wilson, seminary professor, spiritual director,&lt;br /&gt; 
and author of Into &lt;em&gt;Abbas Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The ending essays on shame, self-worth, boundaries, healing, and codependency are a goldmine for anyone in recovery.&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>Weigh Yourself Slim - M Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you truly fed up with being overweight and struggling with fad, yo-yo diets? Are you ready to lose weight forever and invest more than ten days into a diet? 
If you answered yes to these questions, then this book is for you. 
Weigh Yourself Slim is a new and unique method that
will not only help you lose weight, but will turn you into a slim person, physically and mentally; 
does not endorse strange diet or exercise programmes; 
is unique to you; 
provides no dietary restrictions; and 
is natural and healthy. 
In contrast to most current diets, this method doesnt make silly promises about unrealistic, quick weight loss, but it does promise long-term results with no danger to your health. It goes down to the root of the problem of obesity, which is that people have lost their natural ability to balance their diet. With a little help of weighing scales, this book provides a dynamic program on how you can reintroduce that ability and begin your personal journey to your ideal weight. Equally as important, this system will enable you to maintain that ideal weight for the rest of your life." />

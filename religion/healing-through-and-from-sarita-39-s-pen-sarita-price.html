  <title>Healing Through and &quot;From Sarita&#39;s Pen&quot; - Sarita Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Healing Through and From Saritas Pen&lt;/em&gt; is unique because the inspirational and motivational quotes and prayers were designed to be a blessing to others even while I was going through hurt, pain and the disappointment of divorce . As a preacher, a teacher, and a leader in my church, and I was going through this unthinkable situation. But then, God gave me Jeremiah 29:11 (NLT); For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. It was then that I changed my perspective of why he wanted me to write. The writing was not for me, it was to help others. Yet in the process of writing, I was being healed. All the trials and tribulations I was going through became less and less traumatic. While I was focusing on helping others, God handled my issues. Obedience is better than sacrifice. God told me he had a new beginning waiting for me, but I must let go of the past. He told me to not let the enemy keep me depressed and discouraged. He would not let one door close without opening another one for me. When the devil reminds me of my past, remind him of his future. I wrote almost daily, contributing to the healing of others, and &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; healed at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>All Women Are Bitches, and All Men Are Bastards - Nina van der Plas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Men and women are perhaps more alike than either would care to admit. In this guide, former Personal Development Coach and Personal Trainer Nina van der Plas invites you to laugh at how very human we all are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Women Are Bitches, and All Men Are Bastards allows us to take a closer look at ourselves before we point a finger at the opposite sex. By providing valuable insights into what goes on behind the scenes in our actions, she helps her clients to understand that everything works in balance. Lessons we learned in childhood are played out in our adult lives, and the more aware we become, the easier it is for us to break these patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new way of being can begin with something as simple as a change in focus. This can be difficult, as it can challenge a relationship to growor grow apart. Fear is what keeps people from pushing ahead, and the old safeguard of at least Im not alone seems like a safe haven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we loved ourselves enough, we would never allow ourselves to be miserable, hurt, or sad. By changing our behaviour and holding ourselves responsible, we can learn true respect for our selves and others, self-confidence, self-empowerment, integrity, a healthy body image, and an uninhibited sense for creative expression. Once we learn to look within and from anothers point of view, we can have more valuable relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a journey inwardsandpaper for the soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The 12 Touchstones of Good Teaching: A Checklist for Staying Focused Every Day - Bryan Goodwin, Elizabeth Ross Hubbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Checklists help us work better. They help us manage complex tasks more effectively and ensure we apply what we know correctly and consistently. They&#39;ve become indispensable for airline pilots and doctors, but can this low-tech approach to planning and problem solving demand a place in the teacher&#39;s toolkit? Teaching is complicated, with challenging decisions and important consequences, but it&#39;s in the most complex situations that a straightforward checklist can be the most useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodwin and Hubbell present 12 daily touchstones--simple and specific things any teacher can do every day--to keep classroom practice focused on the hallmarks of effective instruction and in line with three essential imperatives for teaching:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Be demanding: Align teaching with high expectations for learning.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Be supportive: Provide a nurturing learning environment.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Be intentional: Know why you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there were one thing you could do each day to help one student succeed, you&#39;d do it, wouldn&#39;t you? What about three things to help three students? What if there were 12 things you could do every day to help all of your students succeed? There are, and you&#39;ll find them here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This product listing is for the reflowable (ePub) version of the book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

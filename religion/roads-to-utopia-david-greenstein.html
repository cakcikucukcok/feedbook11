  <title>Roads to Utopia - David Greenstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the greatest book of Jewish mysticism, the &lt;I&gt;Zohar&lt;/I&gt; is a revered and much-studied work. Yet, surprisingly, scholarship on the &lt;I&gt;Zohar&lt;/I&gt; has yet to pay attention to its most unique literary device—the presentation of its insights while its teachers walk on the road. In these pages, rabbi and scholar David Greenstein offers the first examination of the &quot;walking on the road&quot; motif.
Greenstein&#39;s original approach hones in on how this motif expresses the struggles with spatiality and the everyday presented in the &lt;I&gt;Zohar&lt;/I&gt;. He argues that the walking theme is not a metaphor for realms to be collapsed into or transcended by the holy, as conventional interpretations would have it. Rather, it conveys us into those quotidian spaces that are obdurately present alongside the realm of the sacred. By embracing the reality of mundane existence, and recognizing the prosaic dimensions of the worldly path, the &lt;I&gt;Zohar&lt;/I&gt; is an especially exceptional mystical treatise. In this volume, Greenstein makes visible a singular, though previously unstudied, achievement of the &lt;I&gt;Zohar&lt;/I&gt;." />

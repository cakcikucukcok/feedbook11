      <meta name="description" content="What if you had the power to change your life? To take matters into your own hands and become the king or queen of your own kingdom? I&#39;m here to tell you that it&#39;s completely possible!
Dr. Mind is the true story of how I used positive thinking to change my life. 
When diagnosed with an incurable disease, you learn that most of the thing we worry about aren&#39;t really that important at all. Everything falls away as you realize that life is the most wonderful gift of all. You become aware of every breath you take and every second you spend as one thought rings through your mind: How can I make it right?
The answer is by taking control of the power that is within you. Changing the way you think about a situation is often the most powerful thing you can do, and Dr. Mind is just the guide to get you started on your journey. 
After all, there is nothing in the world more important than a healthy You." />

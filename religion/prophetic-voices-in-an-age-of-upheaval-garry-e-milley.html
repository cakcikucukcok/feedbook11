  <title>Prophetic Voices in an Age of Upheaval - Garry E. Milley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do the Minor Prophets have to say to Christians today? This book of meditations will surprise and delight with its practical instruction and devotional warmth. Garry Milley succeeds very well in convincing us of the value of the minor prophets, and indeed the entire Old Testament, for the modern evangelical&#39;s spiritual life. As a Bible College professor, the author combines very effectively the qualities of the scholar and a pastor. He values sound learning which aids in the interpretation of the Bible, but he also writes with a pastor&#39;s heart for the laity.
&quot;Garry E. Milley is a person of balance and wisdom and writes with theological perceptivity. He is one of the most thoughtful and progressive Pentecostals whom I have had the privilege of coming to know.&quot;
- Donald G. Bloesch, University of Dubuque Theological Seminary
&quot;The Church of Jesus Christ needs to rediscover the messages of the Old Testament prophets. Prophetic Voices in an Age of Upheaval introduces the church layperson to some of the key ideas found in them and it provides a good format for either individual or group study of the Minor Prophets.&quot;
- Donald A. Leggett, Tyndale University College &amp; Seminary
GARRY E. MILLEY is Professor of Church History and Theology at Master&#39;s College &amp; Seminary in Toronto. Prior to his teaching ministry he was a Chaplain at Memorial University in St. John&#39;s, Newfoundland. He has been adjunct lecturer at Tyndale University College and
Seminary and McMaster Divinity College. Dr. Milley has published numerous articles for religious papers and was a columnist for ChristianWeek, a national Christian newspaper. His special academic interests are in historical theology and Christian spirituality." />

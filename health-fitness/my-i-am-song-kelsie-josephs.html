  <title>My “I Am” Song - Kelsie Josephs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you ask yourself the question of who you want to be, it is not about what you have been told, but how you really feel within. Learn to set your intention by trusting in yourself. It is not just about what you say, but rather the meaning or intention behind it. Learn to YES your way through life by telling yourself and calling yourself exactly what you want to see and be, then KNOW it to be true. It is then that the rest of the world will have no choice but to see you in the same light. By paying close attention to the words I AM, it becomes much easier to understand that you are only truly defined by how you see yourself and in turn how you feel, so make it an amazing experience and choose love.
Positive affirmations are excellent reminders of the light and love we have for ourselves, lifting our spirits and truly connecting us. In showing children the importance of loving themselves and choosing to see themselves in beautiful ways, they will begin to understand their ability to create their own happiness through the way they see themselves and in turn, the world. It is when they have this undeniable love for themselves that they will be able to see the rest of the world with the same level of love. By choosing to see ourselves the way we want to be seen, we create a space for greatness as we express these positive affirmations with meaning, knowing that we absolutely can and do create our reality each and every day." />

  <title>If Only - Jennifer Gilmore</title>

She knows that she is now the same age Bridget was when she placed Ivy for adoption. She knows that Bridget was the one who named her. And she knows that fifteen years ago Bridget disappeared from Ivy&amp;#8217;s and her adoptive moms&amp;#8217; lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivy wants to discover more about herself, but as she goes to find Bridget, she can&amp;#8217;t help but feel that the risks might far outweigh the benefits of knowing where she comes from and why her birth mother chose to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Gilmore brings special yet subtle artistry to her interwoven story, weaving motifs and even seemingly extraneous people through the different iterations to keep each version connected with the others.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;BCCB &lt;/em&gt;(starred review)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Gilmore&amp;#8217;s gritty multigenerational tale not only seeks to ask adoption&amp;#8217;s toughest questions, but dares to offer no easy answers: Not to be missed.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Kirkus &lt;/em&gt;(starred review)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Gilmore&amp;#8217;s writing is emotionally raw yet beautiful, touching upon some traditional Y.A. themes&amp;#8230;with an almost mystical feel.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

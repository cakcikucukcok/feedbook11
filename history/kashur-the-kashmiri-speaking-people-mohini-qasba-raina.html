  <title>Kashur the Kashmiri Speaking People - Mohini Qasba Raina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kashur-The Kashmiri Speaking People is the out come of a dedicated research where in the author on the basis of geological, archeological, chronological and linguistic evidences has presented a truthful and unbiased account of the group she herself belongs to. She projects, and rightly so, that the Kashur from the ancient eras possessed highly developed spiritual and intellectual caliber that helped these people per se to evolve into one of the richest social, religious and literary cultural linguistic group. In this effort she has analyzed and given clarification to certain commonly held misconceptions. 
She explains that legends created by primitive ancestors are not myths made up as entertaining stories but are based on reality and are representations of the living truth that has been perceived by the compilers. 
Those interested in the rich cultural heritage of the Kashur, their architectural acumen, their proficiency in historicity, their mastery in languages, their zeal as torch bearers of various religions, and their ever-changing social order inclusive of their faults and foibles will find this book a great help and a guide. This book even records the excesses, hardships and tyrannies that the Kashur has had to face under the rule of various invaders and usurpers in their long political chronology of almost 5,000 years and the struggles they have had put in, to survive these onslaughts bravely and at times even slyly." />

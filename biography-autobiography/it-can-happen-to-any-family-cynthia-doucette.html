  <title>It Can Happen to Any Family - Cynthia Doucette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I left her room and went to bed. I lay next to David, but we did not speak. There were no words to describe the pain we were in. I thought about the day that had begun so pleasurably and ended so painfully. Even so, I thanked God for the blessings in my life, as I did every night. I asked Him to watch over Candice and provide her with the help she needed. We had not been able to give her what she required. Nothing had worked as we had hoped. I am glad I didnt know then how tragically her storyand ourswould end. What had happened to Candice, and where did it all begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of an ordinary family struggling with an extraordinary problem: a special child whose journey was hijacked by teenage drug use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candice Doucette was a beautiful and well-loved young girl with many friends and talents and supportive parents. What happened to her and her family can happen to any family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, her mother candidly shares her experience, in hopes that other parents will find this book a resource as they strive to answer the recurring question, What can we do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, nine years later, Cynthia writes an epilogue to give the reader insight into her life today. How through her enduring loss of her daughter, she has finally found whats most important: her peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynthia Doucettes compelling memoir shares such deep, intense, emotional family struggles and triumphs. The connection I felt with Cynthia and her daughter, Candice was unreal. It felt as though Candices spirit was with me as I read her life story. Candice spoke through the words of her mother. I could feel Candices happiness, her depression, her pain, and her anger. In this story of her tragic death and the wonderful family she left behind, I found myself becoming a part of the Doucette family, as I can relate to the emotional roller coasters theyve endured. Cynthias outlook on her familys ups and downs is so real and by far one of the most amazing stories Ive ever read. Cynthia is an inspirational author, a role model, a woman who had enough faith, love and strength to put her familys story out for the world. She sacrificed her and her familys privacy to help others in need of answers and guidance in times of crisis. This book clearly proves that this can happen to any family.&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>No Strings Attached (Bradshaw Brothers, Book 3) - Susan Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Some mistakes are worth repeating…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tasha Riordan&#39;s one night with Luc Bradshaw was the best of her life. The following two–when he left her to be thrown into a Bahamian jail on bogus charges–were her worst. Now, seven years later, the undercover DEA agent is back. Invading her town. Her restaurant. Her fantasies. She can&#39;t trust a man who lied to her. Yet neither can she trust herself–not when their chemistry burns even hotter than before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learning he has two half brothers shocks Luc. Discovering they live in the same town as Tasha–that&#39;s a different kind of thrill. Their mutual lust is still off the charts, but he can&#39;t get her to listen to his side of what happened on that long-ago night. Good thing he&#39;s got powers of persuasion that go deeper than words. Because nothing has ever felt this right….&lt;/p&gt;

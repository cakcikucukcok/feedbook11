  <title>ISTANBUL AYDIN UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDIA, CULTURE AND LITERATURE - Muhammed Nacar, Nigar Çelik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Journal of Media, Culture and Literature, published biannually by the School of Foeign Languages at Istanbul Ayd?n University, Istanbul, Turkey, is an international scholarly journal in English devoted in its entirety to media, culture and literature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Journal of Media, Culture and Literature is committed to the principles of objective scholarship and critical analysis. Submissions and solicited articles are evaluated by international peer referees through a blind review process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a biannual academic journal, IJMCL publishes articles on English language and linguistics, on English and American literature and culture from the Middle Ages to the present, on the new English literatures, as well as on general and comparative literary studies, including aspects of cultural and literary theory. IJMCL also aims to create a critical, discursive space for the promotion and exploration of media, culture and their relations with literature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal addresses a range of narratives in culture, from the novel, poem and play to hypertext, digital gaming and creative writing. The Journal features theoretical pieces alongside new unpublished creative works and investigates the challenges that new media present to traditional categorizations of literary writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal is supported by an interdisciplinary editorial board from Turkey, Europe and Russia under the direction of Editor Dr. Muhammed Nacar. It is published biannually in hard copy as well as a downloadable e-format designed to be compatible with e-readers, PDF and smart-phone settings. This is designed to encourage full-range accessibility and bears a logical sympathy to the range of writings under discussion, many of which feature or are driven by online technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

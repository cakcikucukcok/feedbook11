  <title>The Soul of the Black Butterfly - Rasheeda J. Steward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Book of Psalms; written by David and other Psalmist expresses and releases their heart while giving God praises. The Author of this book has chosen to share her life through written psalms of her own.  She has released from her very soul words of healing, words of enlightenment, words of truth and hope; while giving God Praise.   As you read these metamorphic words of poetry you may find a shadow of your own soul. Perhaps you have found yourself faced with situations in life that has caused you to doubt the very hand of God. From her dark experiences The Soul of the Black Butterfly has bought a light of understanding to many of life&#39;s situations we face today.                                                                                                                                                                            Whoever said the life of a Believer was going to be an easy journey? Contrary to what many hope for, this book portrays the life of a Christian is not always so easy; choices and decisions are not always clear, yet must be made.   In John 16:33 Jesus makes a promising opposing statement. In the world you shall have tribulations This passage conflicts with what we care to hear; after all, before we came to Christ, most of us had been beaten down by life&#39;s mishaps already. This writer has been no exception to the many test and trials of life. In this book the Author boldly reveals how she has stood the promised persecutions and the many afflictions (Ps 34:19, 2Tim 3:12) of life.  In spite of the opposing statement of Christ, the completion of John 16:33 GIVES US HOPE for Victory from life&#39;s promised trials and tribulations and so it is with these written psalms. This freed butterfly has lived her poems and now shares her Glorious Praises and Lessons Learned with you in poetic psalms and mini-stories." />

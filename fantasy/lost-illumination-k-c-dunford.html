  <title>Lost Illumination - K.C. Dunford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When an eerie voice interrupts Christians ordinary life, the familiar scene of the Fall Valley Boarding School crumbles into uncertainty. Soon this boys worries are shifted from the troubles of his past to the terrifying disturbances that haunt him at every turn. In a matter of days, the menacing voices and shadowy shapes become the least of his troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian decides that he must face his foes or live forever in fear. In doing so, a mysterious force drags him into a strange and unfamiliar land where the unnatural terrors are somehow perfectly catered to torment him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isnt long before Christian is discovered by the inhabitants of this new realm. A peculiar but seemingly trustworthy fellow leads him to safety and introduces him to an ancient kingdom that has been lost for ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian may think himself a victim of circumstance, but he soon discovers that he has been chosen to determine the fate of an ancient people. The task may seem impossible, but if Christian does not succeed, hundreds of lives may be lost . . . and billions cursed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrors are relentless, the secrets are endless, and the expectations that are thrown upon this thirteen-year-old boy are almost overwhelming. The past may have stolen his hope for the future, but Christian must decide if he has the courage to abandon his doubts and seize the path to a truly unfathomable destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Through the Eyes of a Child: Poetry and Short Stories - Alexandria Dread</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My life is a blank canvas, though, An unsung melody, An unwritten book, only a thought. And from the delicate quill Of a pure white feather ... Alexandria Dread loves transporting others beyond the normal and into an imaginary world created through the power of words. In her first collection of writings, Dread relies on humor, compassion, and heart to share a powerful message that people of all ages see the world in similar ways. Dread poetically leads others through her life as she struggled with emotions and fears on the first day of school; contemplated why accomplishments that are touted to be a &quot;piece of cake&quot; never result in an actual piece of cake; found comfort in the sun, sky, and stars; and why at nighttime, everyone gets ready for bed-except the monster under her bed. Included in the collection are several imaginative and entertaining short stories. Through the Eyes of a Child shares poetry and tales from a teenager inspired by real-life experiences growing up in today&#39;s world." />

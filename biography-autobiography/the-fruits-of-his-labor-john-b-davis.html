  <title>The Fruits of His Labor - John B. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE FRUITS OF HIS LABOR:
      The true story of Professor Edmond Jefferson Oliver, Principal of Fairfield Industrial High School, its staff, its students, community, state of Alabama, the Nation and the World!!!
						By John B. Davis, Class of 1951
      Fruit results from planted seeds, when seeds grow, they bear fruit,
Galations 5:22, 23
      We were taught that the fruit that you have to reach for is the sweetest!!
      The fruits of his labor are many: the world is blessed with Fairfield Industrial High School (F.I.H.S.) graduates eschewing their accomplishments through serving others!!
      As one of our graduates, Lois Macon, eloquently proclaimed, There was a place called FAIRFIELD INDUSTRIAL HIGH SCHOOL and a man named EDMOND JEFFERSON OLIVER and his vision was to educate the coloreds living in a colored community, children of colored parents who worked at colored jobs to send their colored children to a colored school.
      The visionary, Professor Oliver with head bloody, but unbowed still forged ahead. Each drop of blood in the sand, like living water produced living fruit, sprouting all around is evidence of his passion. He calls to the visionaries and awaits that army to understand that each child of mother F.I.H.S. also has a purpose; that each is, and that is will be is when he or she is!
      We, the graduates of Fairfield Industrial High School, are the fruits of his labor and some of our stories are unfolded in this book.
      Like a plant, Professor Olivers roots are showing. He grew good people in our small town with honesty, sincerity and dignity!
      Drop this book on the floor and where ever it opens, it will be excellent reading! This true story is dedicated to our BLACK Community (I choose to capitalize the word (BLACK), because of all the hell we caught and are still catching in this country)!" />

  <title>The Sonnets of Gary Langford - Gary Langford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sonnets of Gary Langford is a collection of his best sonnets, a few reprinted from his previous books, Gary Langford Reading From His Poems, www.poetryarchive.org Others were written for what is his ultimate collection of sonnets, aptly published as his fourteenth book of poetry for this very reason. Many of the sonnets are gems.
Gary is the author of 34 books, of which 10 are novels, 4 are collections of stories, 14 are poetry, 3 are drama sketches, and 2 are textbooks of writing, along with his recent Memoir of a Teacher Writer.
The collection shows his wide approach to story telling, as he has used sonnets in some of his plays, and, as you will see here, he turns pieces of his prose into sonnet form, drum tight, yet easy to understand. Each of these is a selected piece he has finely crafted. This has one of his best prose endings in his novel, Newlands, performed many times, including on the radio, and now as a prose sonnet.  He has a few visual sonnets as well in this beautiful work of contemplative thought and comedy.
Walking through the sonnets.

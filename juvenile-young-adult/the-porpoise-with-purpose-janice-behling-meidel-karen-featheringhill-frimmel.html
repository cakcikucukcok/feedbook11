  <title>The Porpoise with Purpose - Janice Behling-Meidel, Karen Featheringhill Frimmel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Porpoise with Purpose is a lighthearted rhyme that gently promotes the importance of making wise life choices. A sense of worth is gained in discovering the joy of living with a God-shaped purpose. The vivid, hand-painted illustrations capture the underwater meanderings of a loveable porpoise, his whimsical friends, and his entertaining quest to find purpose and meaning. Based on the Great Commandment of Matthew 22, this book is a delightful tool in building a rewarding sense of identity into young, imaginative lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragically, many adults meander through life without finding their God-given purpose. In her book A Porpoise with Purpose, Janice Behling lets little ones know that they are born with a destiny; they are born with Gods dream inside them! She plants a seed in their hearts to pursue that purpose and live the adventure God has for them. &lt;br /&gt;

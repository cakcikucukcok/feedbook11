  <title>Seasons of Change - Matthew Morrill, Stephn Tutt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up in the 1960s and 70s, then maturing to adulthood and entering the workforce in the 80s has created almost a schizophrenic identity for Bryce F. Derneher. Derneher faces life with a multitude of conflicts between family, career, love interests, friends and life goals. Todays world doesnt respect quality or values; instead, speed-to-market and efficiencies in workflows are the corporate ideals.
&lt;P&gt;
In Bryces heart, he knows that the deep-rooted good values from yesteryear are hidden within most people. People are just afraid today to show them. At least he has to believe in his heart that people are just afraid to show their values. Surely, people arent as bad as their daily actions in life.
&lt;P&gt;
From the 2001 perspective, values demonstrate weakness in the marketplace. Values make the worker a liability and less important to a corporation then the dollar in the coffer at the end of the day.
&lt;P&gt;
The dollar is number-one! People are number two. Values are bad business. Profit margins are the only concern.
&lt;P&gt;
The most curious aspect of life today is what happens when values meet the technologically cold world of the 21st century.
&lt;P&gt;
Can the person true to his values survive?" />

  <title>Flag - Marc Leepson, Nelson DeMille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The thirteen-stripe, fifty-star flag is as familiar an American icon as any that has existed in the nation&#39;s history. Yet the history of the flag, especially its origins, is cloaked in myth and misinformation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flag: An American Biography&lt;/i&gt; rectifies that situation by presenting a lively, comprehensive, illuminating look at the history of the American flag from its beginnings to today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist and historian Marc Leepson uncovers scores of little-known, fascinating facts as he traces the evolution of the American flag from the colonial period to the twenty-first century. &lt;i&gt;Flag &lt;/i&gt;sifts through the historical evidence to---among many other things---uncover the truth behind the Betsy Ross myth and to discover the true designer of the Stars and Stripes. It details the many colorful and influential Americans who shaped the history of the flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Flag,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; as the novelist Nelson DeMille says in his preface, &quot;is not a book with an agenda or a subjective point of view. It is an objective history of the American flag, well researched, well presented, easy to read and understand, and very informative and entertaining.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our love for the flag may be incomprehensible to others, but at least we now have a comprehensive guide to its unfolding.&quot;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The fascination of history is in its details, and the author of &lt;i&gt;Flag: An American Biography&lt;/i&gt; knows how to find them and turn them into compelling reading....

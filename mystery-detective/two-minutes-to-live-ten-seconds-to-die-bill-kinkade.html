By the end of his first year in uniform he had killed one man, shot and wounded another and seemed to be in hot water with his brass and the city politicians. Then he discovered another, darker side of police work that had its own unique methods of dealing with criminals. Determined to pursue his career in law enforcement, he plunged deeper into the system, discovering the corruption that crept into the system from unexpected sources.

  <title>An Angel to Die For - Mignon F. Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prentice Dobson has just lost her job, her boyfriend, almost everything that has until now made her feel complete. To collect her thoughts and mourn her younger sister&#39;s recent passing, Prentice leaves the city for her small hometown in Georgia. But there is no comfort to be found in the beloved town of her youth-the town is aquiver with the news that her Uncle Faris&#39; grave has been dug up, perhaps by vandals. And Prentice begins to doubt the simple reasons she has been given for her sister&#39;s death. She needs help, desperately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just in the nick of time, in steps the baggage-toting, wisecracking guardian angel, Augusta Goodnight, sent down from Heaven for just such emergencies. Perhaps Heaven&#39;s best angel-sleuth, Augusta usually tends to Heaven&#39;s vast strawberry fields, but for people at their wit&#39;s end, like Prentice, she is always on-call. In her guardian angel, Prentice finds the strength she needs to investigate the lives of her dead relatives, although, in the case of Augusta Goodnight, &quot;dead&quot; is relative. Resourceful, amiable, and literally down-to-earth, Augusta helps Prentice try to both uncover the reasons for her sister&#39;s death and cover her uncle&#39;s grave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mignon F. Ballard&#39;s charming and funny mystery, starring the unstoppable Augusta Goodnight, is the second in a series hailed by critics as &quot;heavenly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Bessie Sue Helps Her Parents - Jocelyn Sophia Poesnecker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warm greetings to you!  I would like to introduce myself.  I am Jocelyn Sophia Poesnecker, and I have authored and illustrated a new children&#39;s book, the first in a series, that is unique in nature.  As a mother of five, and being a devout believer in God, I was upset with the lack of good children&#39;s literature available.  After teaching children singing at a private school for 20 years, I now have devoted my time to producing truly good children&#39;s literature, with appealing illustrations.  My objective is to present stories that show children the right way to live one&#39;s life, while being clever and very intelligent.  My first series features a character named Bessie Sue, a poor girl in Bosnia, who is ever cheerful, praising God no matter the situation.  In the first of this series, BESSIE SUE HELPS HER PARENTS, she longs to delight her parents by going out to milk the cow, in the cold, and to bring back the milk to prepare hot chocolate for them.  The text is rhyming and the vocabulary is lush.  My hope is that many an adult will sit, with a beloved child next to them, and read them this story, which opens up many windows of discussion about how other people live, and how it is important to make good choices in one&#39;s life, while ever praising and thanking God.
I dream of some people with means providing this book, and the others I have prepared, to children in need, be they students, patients in a hospital, orphans, or refugees.  I want the dear children of the world to have something in the English language that is uplifting and truly beneficial.  
BESSIE SUE HELPS HER PARENTS is also available on amazon.com, barnes and noble.com, and other international online bookstores.  Being a teacher for many years, I believe that if you purchase one copy and read it to a kindergarten or 1st grade class, you will be so thrilled with the reaction of your students, and will wish to include reading this book as part of your routine.
I would so love to receive email letters from those who read my books, and I strive to answer all letters personally.  My address is jspoesnecker@gmail.com and my phone number is 267 300 8999" />

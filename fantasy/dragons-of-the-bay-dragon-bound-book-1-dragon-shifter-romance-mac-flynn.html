  <title>Dragons of the Bay: Dragon Bound, Book 1 (Dragon Shifter Romance) - Mac Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sophie, a normal human with normal problems, unknowingly makes the biggest decision of her life when she takes a night walk through the park. &amp;nbsp;She stumbles upon a swirling mystery that pulls her into new troubles, and a new world. &amp;nbsp;There she finds herself falling into one misadventure after another that leads her into the arms of a handsome dragon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Euclid is a dragon of high blood, but has distanced himself from his family and birthplace. &amp;nbsp;He returns to his home after a long absence only to find himself the unwilling owner of a newly arrived Maiden, a human woman from the other world. &amp;nbsp;At first he seeks only to find her a place in her new world, but he soon learns that the only place he wants her to be is by his side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Together they learn to live and love, but a dark mystery blocks out any future happiness for the pair. &amp;nbsp;Shadows lurk in the narrow streets of the bay city and a threat comes from across the sea to do the bidding of a vengeful monster. &amp;nbsp;Their newfound bonds must carry them through the darkness before the shadows sweep them away and into the arms of an ancient horror." />

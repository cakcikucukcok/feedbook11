  <title>Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ - Harold W. Hoehner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;Jesus Christ entered into the history of our world. Christianity, therefore, has historical basis. The backbone of history is chronology. Whereas history is a systematic account of events in relation to a nation, institution, science, or art; chronology is a science of time. It seeks to establish and arrange the dates of past events in their proper sequence. Thus chronology serves as a necessary framework upon which the events of history must be fitted. In this book (the author) attempts to establish certain fixed dates in our Lord&#39;s life.&quot; - Dr. Harold W. Hoehner. Dr. Hoehner has gathered a vast amount of data, both from Scripture and extrabiblical sources, to support his conclusions concerning key dates in the life of our Lord, among them: - The Date of Christ&#39;s Birth - The Commencement of Christ&#39;s Ministry - The Duration of Christ&#39;s Ministry - The Year of Christ&#39;s Crucifixion He carefully documents his position and compares the date available--including a study of Greek words, Roman law, and Jewish customs and prophecy.&lt;/P&gt;" />

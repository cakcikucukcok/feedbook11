        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Little Consequences&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An illegitimate baby was fodder for the local gossips - especially when the identity of the baby&#39;s father was uncertain. But Riona knew that Cameron Adams, the wealthy American who owned the farm she managed in Scotland, was her son&#39;s father. He was also the man who&#39;d left her without a word.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Cam returned and took one look at the five-month-old baby in her arms, Riona&#39;s deepest fear became a reality. Cam gave her a choice - a marriage of convenience to legitimize their son… or a custody battle that Riona knew only Cam could win!&lt;/p&gt;

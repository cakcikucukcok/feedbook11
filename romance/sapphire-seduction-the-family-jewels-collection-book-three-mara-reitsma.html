  <title>Sapphire Seduction - The Family Jewels Collection Book Three - Mara Reitsma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Damn Hayden was persistent. Even after all this time, knowing she was forbidden, unattainable. Married! He still just had to see her. What was it that kept him coming back? Sure she had had admirers, but nothing like him. Laurence on the other hand seemed distant, consumed with his company, always with the business trips.     So when the secrets start piling up, and a close friend turns up missing, Fallyn finds herself having to put on her big girl panties and dive right in. With a vow renewal in one hand, and a mystery to which her husband may be linked in the other, she has no choice but to play her role.     Can Fallyn handle riding with the big boys long enough to find out the truth? Or will it land her in even more trouble than ever before?" />

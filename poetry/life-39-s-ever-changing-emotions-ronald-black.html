  <title>Life&#39;s Ever Changing Emotions - Ronald Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is something that we all share, each time that we think a thought. We think in poetry, only some of us are not able to put it in words but thoughts of poetry live in our hearts. We are filled with emotions and that is what poetry is. You need to just open your heart to the words written for they are the words coming from a heart just like you. From our pain and our sacrifices to our joy and happiness, when you read this we will be able to see that we are all the same seeking love and a dream that we can claim.
There are times when we may feel lost and there is nothing that we can do. The truth is that there will always be options for us to choose. Only with our ever changing emotions at the time we are blind to see. For every action there is an opposite reaction. There are things that we know that we can do yet we get caught up in the things that we are going through. There are times when we are happy and times when we are sad. It is a delicate balance in the lives that we live. Each of us will need to come to grips with the way that we feel. We are never alone although we think at the time that we are alone. We need to find the courage to reach out and say that we are here. Is there anyone out there that care about the lives that we live? At the end of the day if we listen closely we will be able to hear a voice saying that I am here, you are not alone. Ever changing emotions is what will live in our hearts. We just have to decide the things that we want to do and find the courage to follow them through. 
The Life that I have had to live has been very difficult but the love in my heart kept me strong even when I sometimes may have felt alone. I have cried my share of tears and I have suffered many years but I kept the love in my heart. We are human and we make mistakes but as long as we live there will always be another road for us to take.
I pray that the poems that you are reading help you to understand that we all go through lifes ever changing emotions. We have to live in the moment and if that moment continues to last then we should remember that our lives are made up of our past, present and our future. For as long as we live we can change the way that we feel. Love and forgiveness is what we should always hold most precious in our lives.  Love and forgiveness can forever live in our hearts. Poetry is something that we all share, each time that we think a thought. We think in poetry, only some of us are not able to put it in words but thoughts of poetry live in our hearts. We are filled with emotions and that is what poetry is. You need to just open your heart to the words written for they are the words coming from a heart just like you.

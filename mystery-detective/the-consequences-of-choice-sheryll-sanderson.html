  <title>The Consequences of Choice - Sheryll Sanderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;AND SO IT BEGINS . . .LOST AND FOUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new government and a new beginningfree of financial and healthcare worries. That was the promise to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are subtle at first, but the people soon learn that promises made for the good of the country are not what they expected. The government that once swore to care for its citizens has revealed its true colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our military returns home from the war by order of a government they do not understand to a country they do not recognize. However, one soldier will not be coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sandy Parker struggles to cope with her loss, care for her two sons, and run the small family ranch, Tom Connelly and Kyle Johnson make their way to the small town of Willow Creektheir objective, deliver a message to the wife of their fallen brother-in-arms. The arrival of the two soldiers could not have come at a better time and Sandy and her family realize that Gods Hand is at work in bringing them all together. Friendships are made, and bonds are strengthened as they begin a journey to find others, like themselves who still believe in their country and have faith that God will bring them through the inevitable war that will be waged on the good citizens and faithful Christians of the United States a war with only one viable outcome. Some will pay the ultimate price to defend their beloved country and deliver their loved ones from an enemy that will go to any length to get what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Colonial Conspiracies in Africa - Maduka E. Agbodike Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This masterpiece is perhaps the most controversial treatise ever written by an African author or published. I have been reading various books but this is the first time I read one, which analytically used religious books, sciences, historic facts, various mysteries and nature to present, in simple manner most of the wonders of this weird world we live in Blasphemous heresies cum different human efforts cryptically inculcated into religious beliefs, which are unknowingly propagated and practised in almost every part of the world, were skilfully unmasked. &lt;br&gt;
Fraudulent honest beliefs cannily brewed at various philosophic caves of the developed world, geared towards minds slavery, then spewed into ethno-politics of the day and religious bodies, which enabled them hold the world at their mercies, were plainly unveiled.&lt;br&gt;
Colonial Conspiracies in Africa, like merciless and unapologetic hot knife while slicing through every butter or cheese created or produced by the world ruling class fibs potions, never respected or feared; just the way, she acting as the only Divine detergent, bleached every dye stain or taint on religious cum political maladies of our day!&lt;br&gt;
I am afraid, all the deep secrets in human hearts, which this book opened up and made very easy as well as palatable to swallow, no one truly sincere enough, can contest!&lt;br&gt;
This is that philological Murdered Truth about Gihons (Africans) in particular and other oppressed nations, which you must know. This shall set our one-sided historic records straight and stop further deceptive or exploitative symbiotic co-existance amongst human race! Africa is not the dreg of Human wastes, rather the only true Father of entire Human Race! This is Divinely inspired Power packed Epistle to the world at large. Study with reverence!&lt;br&gt;
This treatise shall be read and remembered forever! She is a revolutionary masterpiece!" />

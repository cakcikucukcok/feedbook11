  <title>Fertilizer ’Tween My Toes - Marshall Rowland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Despite the hard knocks of life, Marshall Rowland, a true country boy from Georgia, somehow managed to find fame and a little bit of fortune through hard work, gambles with fate, and a love of country music.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In his autobiography, Rowland begins with stories from his childhood during 1930s Georgia that detail the heartbreaking day when his mother was taken away; his subsequent move to a rural area, where he shoveled cow manure out of the barns; and the day when he first met little Henry Wiggins, the boy who first introduced him to country music. He had a challenging upbringing and minimal formal education, but he still managed to find success and happiness within the world of country music. He followed Ray Charles in a hillbilly band, became a disc jockey, and spent an evening with Elvis when he was sixteenall events that eventually led to a career owning several radio stations throughout Florida and Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fertilizer tween My Toes&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring, true story of how a country boy with little education and no parental guidance achieved financial success, discovered happiness, and, most importantly, survived his lifes most challenging moments.&lt;/p&gt;" />

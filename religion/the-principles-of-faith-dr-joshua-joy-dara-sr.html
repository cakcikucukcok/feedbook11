  <title>The Principles of Faith - Dr. Joshua Joy Dara Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt&quot;&gt;The word faith is quite familiar to most Christians in the world. I first heard about it as a little boy growing up in rural &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Africa&lt;/st1:place&gt;. Like most people, the idea of having faith in God sounds good to my ears. However, as I mature in the Lord and heard many people teach about faith, I began to see many loop holes and outright misinformation on the subject. I must admit that it provoked me to start a long journey of trying to get a clearer picture of what faith is really about. I simply wanted to find an answer to simple questions like what is faith, how do I get it, and how do I use it effectively. Like King Solomon, &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that is done under heaven.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;B style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;Ecclesiastes 1:13&lt;/B&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Also, I would like to share with you some of my own personal faith-walk experiences in life. I believe that one can learn from the experience of others. I want you to be able to learn from my life what I called my faith walk experiences. Finally, it is my earnest desire to teach you about faith in such a way that you would never have any misunderstanding concerning the subject. In short, my assignment is to help you avoid the errors and pitfalls of many teachers and instead reveal to you the heart of God concerning the subject of faith. Believe me, if you read this book prayerfully with an open mind, your life would never be the same again.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />

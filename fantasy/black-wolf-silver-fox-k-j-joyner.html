  <title>Black Wolf, Silver Fox - K. J. Joyner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;There were five of them: Aramina, Raori, Duinn, Eahn, and Picket. They were friends, serving as elite assassins in the elf world. Raori was their mage, Duinn their builder, Picket the trickster, and Eahn the leader. Aramina was The Priestess, their heart - and her very presence tore at the mind and heart of Finnbhear, the Silver Fox: a man who stood against them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was before the team was retired and the kingdom fell into years of suffering at the hands of their cruel master.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her master is calling for them again. He&amp;#39;s asking that they rid the world forever of the only remaining tie to the land: a prince.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obeying this command is an opportunity for one of many things. She and the others could gain more stature in their master&amp;#39;s eyes. They could win their freedom. They could find love - or rediscover it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They can also die trying - as chaos takes their lives and no action they take makes sense nor seems sane. And Aramina - whom Finnbhear can not forget - still stands at the center after all these years. &amp;nbsp;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;" />

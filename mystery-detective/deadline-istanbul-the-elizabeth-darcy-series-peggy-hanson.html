  <title>Deadline Istanbul (The Elizabeth Darcy Series) - Peggy Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elizabeth Darcy is in the world&#39;s most intriguing city to cover for old friend and fellow correspondent Peter Franklin, found dead in the Bosphorus.  She&#39;s convinced it wasn&#39;t an accident. But uncovering secrets can be a dangerous business.  Are spies involved? Criminals? Where does religion become politics, and vice versa? And who are those men following her? &lt;P&gt; Danger stalks her through the ancient streets. Elizabeth will be lucky to return safely to Washington. Fortunately, she has her Jane Austen book and the cat Sultana to hold onto -- as long as that comfort lasts! &lt;P&gt; &quot;When journalist Elizabeth Darcy travels to Istanbul to investigate the death of a friend and colleague, she is quickly immersed in a Byzantine world of secrets and deception. Peggy Hanson&#39;s evocative description of this city of minarets and sultan&#39;s palaces is as vibrant and rich as a multi-colored Turkish carpet.&quot; -- Ellen Crosby, author of Multiple Exposure &lt;P&gt; &quot;Deadline Istanbul introduces a smart, determined new detective, a newspaper reporter with a can-do spirit and a sense of humor. Istanbul itself, ancient and modern, filled with its own mysteries and contradictions, comes to life in Peggy Hanson&#39;s admirable novel. Well done!&quot; -- Anne Hillerman, author of Spider Woman&#39;s Daughter, a Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee mystery" />

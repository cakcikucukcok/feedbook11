  <title>The Gnomes of Westminster - B. Vincent Chenier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peripheral vision is sight outside the very center of gaze, that&#39;s where you will find them.  In the woods, on the meadows, that rustling of leaves, the unknown stir...they have always been there, you just have to use your peripheral vision.  
Logan made up his mind to quickly turn and run down the hill to fetch Nicholas before the rainbow disappeared.  Unfortunately that was a big mistake for him for he was standing upon a small rock that was pushed deep in the mud.  As Logan spun around, the rock spun as well and Logan lost his footing.  No matter how Logan flailed his arms to keep his balance he could not stop his fall and down he went upon his back.  Logan fell so quick that when he landed flat on his back his arms and legs were still sticking straight up in the air.  Logan looked like an upended turtle as he lay in the mud.  The only part of Logan that was in the mud was the small of his back and that was not enough to hold him in place.  Logan felt his body twisted to the right so he leaned into the turn and that was his second mistake for it took him over the edge of the hill.  Now, if he had been thinking, he could have grabbed one small bush that would have saved him from the wildest ride in his life..." />

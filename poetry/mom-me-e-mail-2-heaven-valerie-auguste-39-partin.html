  <title>Mom Me : E-Mail 2 Heaven - Valerie Auguste&#39;-Partin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Mom Me,
Why did I write the book sequel to Mom Me: Soaring Through The Pain ? Th e answer is simple. I need people to understand the difference between the grief journey of losing your mother to more than one terminal illness vs. just losing your mother to natural causes. Some folks still believe that I should be over my loss by now. Fortunately, many of them still have their own mothers and can never empathize with me. Why should they? 
A mother is the extraordinary superwoman who inhaled the breath of life into you for (9) miraculous months. She exhaled you to the world during the slow and painful labor process. To watch my physically strong, healthy and powerful mother who gave me life, lose her own life slowly and painfully to not one, but two terminal illnesses, left a dark stain and a traumatic impression on me emotionally. 
It is difficult to transition smoothly to the happy moments shared together when the recent memories of their physical anguish and suffering still haunt and torment you. For many of us, these emotional demons are worst at night when you are alone with your nocturnal thoughts.
 This book is dedicated to her undying memory and incredible legacy. Contributions will be sent to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) in memory of Esther M. Auguste." />

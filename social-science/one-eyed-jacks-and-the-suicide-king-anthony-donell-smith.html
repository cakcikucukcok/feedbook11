  <title>One-Eyed Jacks and the Suicide King - Anthony Donell Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stages of Literature
The sorcerer dawned with skills of voodoo. The tarot card depicts the sorcerer from the voodoo stage, and he permeated into an image, with its symbols of the English court.
The tragicomedy period (old English) dispelled the notion of the sorcerer being placed between us and our maker. Of course even without the sorcery, forces continued to defy logic. Properties of voodoo, through perspectives, were at the helm.
Laws of force were soon accepted by the maturing world. Although these forces have constructs that are not visible, the effects were known to be very consistent. Testing such laws proved reliable to cause and effect.
The age of reason brought wisdom, through retrospect, of how we react to the unknown and unexplained. We simply make up what we do not know. However, we do so by taking the perspectives we are granted and reasoning out the realities that lie within. With reality being created from our crooked and unaligned perspectives, our realities pale in comparison to Gods truths.
The Romantic Period paired our realizations of reason and logic up against the phenomenon we call emotions. Emotions won hands down. Earlier chronicles of man demonstrate mystery, but the mystics are to the nth power within emotions.
The day of the zodiac combines logics and emotions and is depicted by the symbols of civilization. Each past civilization will leave signs of what they most feared and what they most needed (adored). The interrelation of humans is controlled by the celestial constellations, aligning our compatibility to one another. It barely scratches the surface of why we are magnetized to some while we are polarized from others.
Charms of Makings caused her end. Makings of charm will set and begin." />

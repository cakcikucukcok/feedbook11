  <title>The Affairs of Rabbi Flowers - Ted Pailet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recently discharged from active military service, a young, inexperienced rabbi named Conrad Flowers seeks a position of service. Its the mid-1970s, a time when people write letters to communicate and hesitate to make long-distance callstoo expensive. The rabbis main source of information is his seminarys newsletter, and he scours the want ads.
After several rejections, he applies for the position of rabbi at a temple in Central-Bella. The congregation is hesitant. Flowers is young and arguably unconventional. Even so, they decide to give him a chance, despite varied opinions in regard to his modern ways. Once on the job, Rabbi Flowers realizes military service was easy; his time at war barely compares with the ins and outs of a Jewish congregation, torn between past and present policies.
Even within the temple environment, people are still just people. There are arguments, affairs, and scandals, even within the guidance of Gods law. The rabbis values are put to the test as he fights to keep Central-Bella from falling apart. Even he is still just a man, but with the aid of the Lord, he might have a fighting chance to bring peace to the temple and to his own questioning mind." />

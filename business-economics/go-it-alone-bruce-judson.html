  <title>Go It Alone! - Bruce Judson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is an epidemic of unhappiness in the American workplace. A full 70 percent of workers in the United States report that they are disengaged from their jobs. When asked, &quot;Do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day?&quot; only 20 percent of nearly 2 million employees said yes. It is no wonder that 56 percent of all Americans dream of starting their own business. So why don&#39;t they do so? Because starting one&#39;s own business is seen as difficult, expensive, and risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this extraordinary book, successful &lt;em&gt;Go It Alone!&lt;/em&gt; entrepreneur Bruce Judson explains that the conventional wisdom about starting your own business is stunningly wrong. Using the leverage of technology -- e-mail, the World Wide Web, and the remarkable array of off-the-shelf business services now available -- it is dramatically easier to start your own business. Magnified by these new services, it is also possible to create, for the first time, a highly focused business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Judson shows you the practical steps that will allow nearly any individual to create a business, often using job skills that seem to require an entire corporation for support. It is no longer necessary to spend time on the tasks that don&#39;t add value. It is now possible to stay small but reap big profits. Go-it-alone businesses allow the individual the freedom to concentrate on their greatest skills. After reading this book, your motto will be &quot;Do What You Do Best, Let Others Do the Rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

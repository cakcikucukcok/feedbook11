  <title>Regeneration: the Way, the Truth, the Life - Jhonny Thermidor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are times when letting go is a choice you have to make to free yourself. Life is still full of beauty. Of course, not every one of us can see the beauty of a particular object at naked eyes simultaneously. In this inspirational book of life, you are presented The Love and The Truth, you are given the way and the opportunity to see life as it was meant to be. Let that truth save you from yourself, let it guide you through regeneration and salvation, let God penetrate and touch every single area of your being as he is your way, your truth, and your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I personally was a barrier to my dream, and through it all I am a victor, I rise above my addictions and obsessions. Shamed am I not for disclosing that, for living is truly a full-time job itself. Make no mistake, its gifted, celestial and precious, but you have to admit that sometimes it is necessary to surrender and declare God, I am through. Its time to let you have control and decide what best for me. Therefore, Im asking you to permit me to invite you in today. I dont want to be alone in this poetic journey through perfection. Allow today to be the day you shine through the challenges that were meant to test your level of resistance and to discourage you. Let this be the miraculous moment to pursuit happiness and to remind you, again, of the beauty of life." />

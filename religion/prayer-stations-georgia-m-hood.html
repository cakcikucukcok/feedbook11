People of all ages, all stations of life and all types of dispositions are asking for guidelines to focused prayer.
Prayer Stations are not just designated locations where believers go, expecting to receive results from God the Father in the name of Jesus, each Prayer Station has focal points that keeps the believer focused while praying.
Prayer Stations allows the believer to go outside his/her comfort zones into praying beyond their intellect in the Spirit.
This book allows the believer to study each Prayer Station with supporting scriptures so that they may pray the will of God effectively,
keep a written journal and to reflect on how the content of each Prayer Station has impacted their lives.
Prayer Stations can be used also on a professional level in counseling sessions, the dynamics of teams, home devotionals and personal use.
Prayer Stations will take a believer from no prayer life to a greater dimension of knowing God." />

  <title>A Dead Hand - Paul Theroux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;A travel writer is drawn into a strange criminal case, and an even stranger romantic affair, in a novel that brings India &amp;ldquo;brilliantly, blazingly to life&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; When Jerry Delfont, an aimless, blocked travel writer, receives a letter from an American philanthropist, Mrs. Merrill Unger, he is intrigued. She informs him about a scandal, involving an Indian friend of her son&amp;rsquo;s. Who is the dead boy, found on the floor of a cheap hotel room? How and why did he die? And what is Jerry to make of a patch of carpet, and a package containing a human hand?&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Jerry is swiftly captivated by the beautiful, mysterious Mrs. Unger&amp;mdash;and revived by her tantric massages&amp;mdash;but the circumstances surrounding the dead boy cause him increasingly to doubt the woman&amp;rsquo;s motives and the exact nature of her philanthropy. Without much to go on, Jerry pursues answers from the teeming streets of Calcutta to Uttar Pradesh. It is a dark and twisted trail of obsession and need.&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; From the author of &lt;I&gt;The Great Railway Bazaar&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;A Dead Hand&lt;/I&gt; is offers &amp;ldquo;an abundance of richly drawn characters&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. Theroux has used his travel writer&amp;rsquo;s eye and ear and his novelist&amp;rsquo;s imagination to craft a tense, disturbing, funny and horrifying book around all of them&amp;rdquo; (&lt;I&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;The real pleasure is Theroux&amp;rsquo;s talent for rendering place and his irreverent comments on everything from the British royals to pop culture, aging, and yes, the venerable Mother Teresa.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

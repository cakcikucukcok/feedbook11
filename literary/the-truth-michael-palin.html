  <title>The Truth - Michael Palin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;An ingeniously plotted, beautifully written and hugely enjoyable book that raises tricky questions about... our need for heroes [and] the price of personal compromise.&#39;&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time since his much-beloved tale &lt;i&gt;Hemingway&#39;s Chair&lt;/i&gt; was published in 1998, Michael Palin pens a new novel featuring the warm and witty story of an everyman, a tantalizing offer, a journey to India, and the search for the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Mabbut is at a crossroads in his life.  A professional writer of some repute, he has reached the age of fifty-six with nothing resembling the success of his two great literary heroes, George Orwell and Albert Camus. When he is offered the opportunity of a lifetime--to write the biography of the elusive Hamish Melville, a widely respected and highly influential activist and humanitarian--he seizes the chance to write something meaningful. His search to find out the real story behind the legend takes Mabbut to the lush landscapes and environmental hotspots of India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more he discovers about Melville, the more he admires him--and the more he connects with an idealist who wanted to make a difference. But is his quarry really who he claims to be? As Keith discovers, the truth can be whatever we make it.  &lt;br&gt;In this wonderful, heartwarming novel, Michael Palin turns his considerable skills to fiction in the story of an ordinary man on an extraordinary adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Palin&#39;s] book is well paced, his prose, carefully hewn, his characters fully developed and convincingly human. And his comic timing is impeccable.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Hemingway&#39;s Chair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book&#39;s strengths are . . . its dry, deftly, understated wit, its careful plot and character construction; it&#39;s clever, on-the-money dialogue . . . Those pleasures carry you a long way.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Hemingway&#39;s Chair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

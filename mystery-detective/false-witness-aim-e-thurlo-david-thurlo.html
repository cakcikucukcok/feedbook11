  <title>False Witness - Aimée Thurlo, David Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Lady of Hope Monastery can&#39;t catch a break. Situated in rural New Mexico, the cloistered monastery squeaks by on donations and various craft and skilled jobs suited to their cloistered, contemplative life. But when a stolen SUV crashes through their outside walls, they are faced with financial demands that far exceed their means. So when a major donor offers a great deal of money for what seems a simple task, they are quick to accept. The very ill John Gutierrez is looking for his estranged niece, believed to be in the area, and having heard of Sister Agatha, the extern nun, and her investigative skills, he turns to them for help. All Sister Agatha has to do is track down the woman, and the monastery&#39;s financial worries will be over.&lt;br&gt;      But nothing is ever as simple as it seems. Sister Agatha&#39;s investigation quickly lands her in the midst of a deadly situation, and  it&#39;s up to her to uncover the truth before it all takes a deadly turn for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;" />

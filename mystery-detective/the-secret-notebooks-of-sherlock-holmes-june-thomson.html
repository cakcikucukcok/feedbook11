  <title>The Secret Notebooks of Sherlock Holmes - June Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scandal, intrigue and cunning crime. Delve into the world of the immortal Sherlock Holmes. In Sherlock Holmes&#39;s London, reputations are fragile and scandal can be ruinous. In order to protect the names of the good (and not-so-good), Dr Watson comes to the decision that his accounts of some of his friend&#39;s most brilliant cases must never see the light of day. And so he conceals the manuscripts in an old despatch box, deep in the vaults of a Charing Cross bank... Now, outlasting the memories of those they could have harmed, these mysteries finally come to light. An aluminium crutch betrays the criminal who relies upon it for support... An Italian Cardinal lies dead in a muddy yard in Spitalfields... What do a pair of suspiciously successful gamblers have in common with the Transylvanian mind-reader, Count Rakoczi? And can Holmes and Watson outwit the jewel thief who has the nerve to steal from the King of Scandinavia?" />

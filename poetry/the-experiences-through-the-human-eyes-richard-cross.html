  <title>The Experiences Through the Human Eyes - Richard Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book of poetry was written to share the experiences of many, who had reached a point in their lives when they thought they could not make it, but they persevered, the experiences are not just through my eyes, but our eyes. If you are on this journey that we call life, and is living from day to day without a plan in mind, your distractions may be greater. If you plan, you will be stronger to withstand the things that are thrown at you; the poetry book shed some light on that aspect. It was through my drive and determination to be successful that I came to the realization that nothing is impossible. To some it was just a dream, but there is no limit to where you can be. Put it in a simple term, success has no limit or is limited to no one. The Experience through the Human Eyes showed that through the experiences one has been through, they have gained knowledge, growth, and the know-how. The inspirations gained through this text will motivate you and keep you grounded. In this book you will also find how different people view each stages of your life. Poetry is a unique, heartfelt expression of the human soul. The collections of this comforting poetry will take you from a state of bad feeling to a state of good feeling. The lifestyle you choose should solely depend on you, not circumstances." />

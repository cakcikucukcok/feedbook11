  <title>I&#39;m Still Here (Je Suis Là) - Clélie Avit, Lucy Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;An irresistible, modern take on &lt;i&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/i&gt;, for fans of Jojo Moyes and David Nicholls. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Elsa has been in a coma for five months. With all hope of reviving her gone, her family and doctors are having to face the devastating fact that it might be time to turn off her life support... They don&#39;t realise that in the past few weeks Elsa has regained partial consciousness; she knows where she is and can hear everyone talking around her bed, but she has no way of telling them she&#39;s there.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thibault is in the same hospital visiting his brother, a drunk driver responsible for the deaths of two teenage girls. Thibault&#39;s emotions are in turmoil and, needing a retreat, he finds his way into Elsa&#39;s room. Seeing her lying there so peacefully, he finds it hard to believe she is not just sleeping. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thibault begins to visit Elsa regularly. As he learns more about her through her family and friends, he begins to realise that he is developing feelings for her. And when he talks to her, he can&#39;t help feeling that she can hear his every word...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For Elsa, his visits are like a breath of fresh air. Here is finally someone who speaks to her as if she is a real life person. Who makes her laugh. And who gives her something to fight for...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;And so begins a love story that might just save both their lives...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

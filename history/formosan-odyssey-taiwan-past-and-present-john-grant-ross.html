      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Until the early twentieth century, Taiwan was one of the wildest places in Asia. Its coastline was known as a mariners&amp;rsquo; graveyard, the mountainous interior was the domain of headhunting tribes, while the lowlands were a frontier area where banditry, feuding, and revolts were a way of life. Formosan Odyssey captures the rich sweep of history through the eyes of Westerners who visited and lived on the island &amp;mdash; from missionaries, adventurers, lighthouse keepers, and Second World War PoWs, to students coming to study martial arts. It finishes with the story of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s economic miracle, the political transition from police state to vibrant democracy, and its continuing stand-off with China.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The author&amp;rsquo;s travels, made around the island in the wake of the devastating 921 earthquake, and his experiences from five years of living in a small town, provide an intimate picture of modern Taiwan.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The island is a storehouse of Chinese and indigenous cultures, a fascinating mix of the new and the traditional, and likewise Formosan Odyssey is a smorgasbord of delights that both the general reader and any &amp;ldquo;old Asia hand&amp;rdquo; will find informative and amusing.&lt;/p&gt;" />

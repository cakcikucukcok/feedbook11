  <title>The Underneath - Melanie Finn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;With the assurance and grace of her acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;The Gloaming&lt;/i&gt;—which earned her comparisons to Patricia Highsmith—Melanie Finn returns with a precisely layered and tense new literary thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Underneath&lt;/i&gt; follows Kay Ward, a former journalist struggling with the constraints of motherhood. Along with her husband and two children, she rents a quaint Vermont farmhouse for the summer. The idea is to disconnect from their work-based lifestyle—that had her doggedly pursuing a genocidal leader of child soldiers known as General Christmas, even through Kay&#39;s pregnancy and the birth of their second child—in an effort to repair their shaky marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It isn&#39;t long before Kay&#39;s husband is called away and she discovers a mysterious crawlspace in the rental with unsettling writing etched into the wall. Alongside some of the house&#39;s other curiosities and local sleuthing, Kay is led to believe that something terrible may have happened to the home&#39;s owners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kay&#39;s investigation leads her to a local logger, Ben Comeau, a man beset with his own complicated and violent past. A product of the foster system and life-long resident of the Northeast Kingdom, Ben struggles to overcome his situation, and to help an abused child whose addict mother is too incapacitated to care about the boy&#39;s plight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Underneath&lt;/i&gt; is an intelligent and considerate exploration of violence—both personal and social—and whether violence may ever be justified." />

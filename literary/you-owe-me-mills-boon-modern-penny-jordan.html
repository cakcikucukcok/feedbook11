  <title>You Owe Me (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seeing Slater again would cause Chris pain. Natalie had always known how desperately in love with Slater Chris had been, and she&#39;d arranged things so that Chris would have to return to England and face the man who&#39;d rejected her. For as a final malevolent gesture she&#39;d entrusted her daughter to Chris&#39;s care.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It would be hard facing Slater again, knowing that he&#39;d shared Natalie&#39;s bed and given her everything Chris had dreamed of – marriage and his child. Chris was torn between her response to a little girl&#39;s suffering and her fear of resurrecting her own foolish dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

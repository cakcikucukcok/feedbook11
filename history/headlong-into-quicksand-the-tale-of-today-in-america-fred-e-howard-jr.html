  <title>Headlong into Quicksand: the Tale of Today in America - Fred E. Howard, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Americas 220 years of Democracy (of its 400 years) is longer than the Greek 100 (of 1000), the Roman 150 (of 1000), or the British 180 (of 1600.)  These European democracies are the only large ones ever.  Two collapsed as demoralized empires.  Two moderns with one heritage of basicly Christian, Northwest European tradition, have been autocraticly led further away into decadent empires than people realized.  That disappearing heritage was Americas constitutional basis and durable strength.  America follows Greco-Roman decay steps toward collapsing empire die-offs after losing common moral understandings and family stability.  Turning toward imperial quicksand began dictatorially in the 1801 court, built to Civil War, softened seemingly in the wild west, peaked untraditionally in the &quot;liberal&quot; socialist double-meanings of the 1930s depression, and led under continuous near-emperors into the post-war anti-traditional, anti-Christian, anti-moral, anti-family decadence of today.  Democratic repairs may exist, if traditional people come together.
     This book links its origin, in HUMAN CREATURES - A BROADER VIEW, to its sequel, TAMING THE VIPERS IN THE SLOUGH, through four histories of democratic civilizations:
   Lost limits on political leaders/governments, demagogues.
   Failed family/religious values.
   Consequent imperial disasters." />

  <title>&quot;Pimp: Reflection of My Life &quot; - Noble Dee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In our society today, although used out their original contexts, the words Pimp and Pimpin have been embraced whole-heartedly by todays hip hop generation and frequently used in slang to describe a motif of a newly set standard of flamboyant living. 
However, in his debut release, Donald Ray Lavan (AKA Noble Dee) provides the true definition of both words, separating the real and the facts from the faade and the fiction of todays controversial terminology. Best of all, he describes in very minute details, what the Game (Pimpin) was like for him in his era the 1960s to Y2K (The New Millienium).
In this tell all non-fiction: Noble Dee illustrates, in a very blaxploitation mannerhis personal existence in the game. Not only does he exploit his successes, he also exposes the very grim details of the life; both in tones whereas you the reader bask in his glory, and share his pains; the pain of possibly regret in the life that he cherished for almost four calendar decades. 
Wholeheartedly, Noble Dee expresses how his own glorification of the game, indirectly allured his first born daughter into a position to be manipulated and exploited by pimps, just as he had manipulated and exploited so many daughters throughout his 35 years plus career. 
Not since Robert Beck revealed to the masses the vivid street Realities of a Pimps Life in his book Pimp: The Story of My Life By Iceberg Slim has the entrenching truth behind the lifestyle-termed pimpin been exposed to this degree. Thus, the primary title Pimp:Reflections of My Life.

          &lt;strong&gt;Discovering the real Dr Randall &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr Lacey Brewer’s fresh start in the beautiful Florida Keys is disrupted from day one by her gorgeous neighbour Jake Randall. He’s fascinating, infuriating, and deeply charismatic. She knows she shouldn’t let this delectable playboy into her life when she needs to focus on adjusting to life in a busy American ER, yet stolen moments in his arms tell Lacey to trust her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her instincts tell her that there is far more to Jake than he lets on. When she discovers that Jake has given up his career as a talented Emergency doctor she knows she has to help him back to his vocation. If she can do that, maybe – just maybe – she can also win his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A Winchester Homecoming (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Pamela Toth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;CHARMING, CONFIDENT, SEXY…AND A HEARTBREAKER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s how rancher David Major remembered his ex-love Kim Winchester. Romance had budded between them in high school, but ended abruptly when Kim moved away without even saying goodbye. Now she was back in his life, and though she was still strikingly beautiful, he wasn&#39;t ready to put his heart on the line again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When she&#39;d returned home to Colorado after ten long years, the last person Kim expected to greet her at the airport was David. Seeing him set her heart aflutter, but she&#39;d changed since she last saw him–matured, made herself over, moved on. As the two grew close again, she regretted leaving him all those years ago, but would she be able to heal his shattered heart?&lt;/p&gt;

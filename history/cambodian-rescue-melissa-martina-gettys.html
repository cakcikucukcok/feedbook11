  <title>Cambodian Rescue - Melissa Martina Gettys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Several years back, I had the privilege of making the acquaintance of a very quiet and unobtrusive young lady from Cambodia. She and her sister were in the United States completing their course of studies at a university where I was teaching that semester. During conversations with her, I discovered that her parents had survived the infamous Killing Fields. Some tales stood out more than the rest. In particular, the tales of American forces heroically pulling out citizens and missionaries just prior to the mass killings by the Khmer Rouge. This is the story of a CIA operative in Cambodia, his protg, his daughter, and an amazing rescue that represents the life and love of a young couple who must now acclimate into an American culture that neither one recalls." />

  <title>Grea’Nock - James Ramey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Greanock&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally meaning green rock, this term was used to describe the way the world was, back in the days of the beginning. Those were the days when Dagoththe first eviland his servants arrived in the world and began an epic war with the four houses of immortals. Those were the days when Kingsteel, a mortal man and warrior smith, defeated Dagothand there was hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those days have gone. Kingsteel is long dead. The might of his blood is lost, and the four houses have grown secretive. In their shadow, the villages of men and dwarfs developed into vast empiresand turned against each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, people came who paved new roads to new places, crafted out of the rubble of the past. Far from war and on the edge of the wild, they built cities reborn from the ashes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two young heroes in the makingthe gentle giant Erik Iron Rod and the girl of his dreams, Gayle Fletcherjoin forces with two mysterious adventurers: Jase, a Quadrian Elf swordsman, and Fenrix, the famous hunter of dragons. Although raised in a peaceful farming town, Gayle and Erik quickly find themselves swept up on a world of war and enchantment teetering on the edge of ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gayle, the girl who would be queen, the future is yet to be written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Greanock&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this term means time lost  and the way the world will never be again.&lt;/p&gt;" />

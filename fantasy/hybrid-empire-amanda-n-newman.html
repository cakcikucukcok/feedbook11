      <meta name="description" content="I still couldn&#39;t believe what I found out about him. The image of him standing in front of me, blood dripping from the corners of his mouth, was still perfectly clear in my mind. At the time, I&#39;d been shocked and slightly scared. I knew he wasn&#39;t a serial killer or anything like that. No, he was a creature of legend, something entirely apart from the human world, something one would find in a sci-fi or fantasy novel. Up until that night, I never thought that vampires or werewolves or any of those kinds of creatures could really exist. Now, I wasn&#39;t so sure, not that he was a vampire. He wasn&#39;t. He was something else entirely, something that wasn&#39;t mentioned in any of the legends I&#39;d learned, a hybrid, half vampire and half werewolf." />

  <title>Rhymes for No Reason - Anton Wills-Eve</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;Standard&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times New Roman;&quot;&gt;This small selection from the poems I have written in English in 2012 is aimed mainly at showing how the different styles of versification and rhyme, especially free or blank verse, have changed in the past year. What matters with the poems in this book is that the readers should imagine they are experiencing the stories, thoughts and ideas for themselves alone and not adhering rigidly to any particular metric pattern or established form. The fact that many of the samples are in fact stories is no coincidence. I find that doing a brief resume of a novel in verse first then makes it much easier to write the ensuing book. Indeed the novel I am currently writing, Locked in and Locked Out, is based largely on two of the poems in this selection. As this is the road down which modern poets are meandering more and more, I am happy to be with them on their pilgrimage as I hope my readers will be also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times New Roman;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anton Wills-Eve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Times New Roman;&quot;&gt;December 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

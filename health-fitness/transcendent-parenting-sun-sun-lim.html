  <title>Transcendent Parenting - Sun Sun Lim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether members of the family are headed to school or work, smartphones accompany family members throughout the day. The growing sophistication of mobile communication has unleashed a proliferation of apps, channels, and platforms that link parents to their children and the key institutions in their lives. While parents may feel empowered by their ability to provide their children assistance with a click on their smartphone, they may also feel pressured and overwhelmed by this need to always be on call for their children.
This book focuses on the phenomenon of transcendent parenting, where parents actively use technology to go beyond traditional, physical practices of parenting. In drawing on the experiences of intensely digitally-connected families in Singapore to tell a global story, Sun Sun Lim argues how transcendent parenting can embody and convey, intentionally or not, the parenting priorities in these households. Chapters outline how parents exploit mobile connectivity to transcend the physical distance between themselves and their children, the online and offline social interaction environments, and the timelessness of seemingly ceaseless parenting. &lt;em&gt;Transcendent Parenting&lt;/em&gt; further explores how mobile communication allows parents to be more involved than ever in their children&#39;s lives, leaving readers to question whether or not parents have become too involved as a result. With its clear discussions of the effects of transcendent parenting on parents&#39; wellbeing and children&#39;s personal development, &lt;em&gt;Transcendent Parenting&lt;/em&gt; will appeal to a broad audience of readers, from scholars, educators and policy makers to parents and young people across the globe." />

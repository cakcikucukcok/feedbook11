  <title>It Seems to Me - Jim Dinsmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It Seems to Me&lt;/i&gt; was created to make the Bible more accessible to the average reader. It offers a sensible approach to the whole Bible, with the primary goal of helping people find modern paths through the ancient book. It focuses on such themes as the ancient context of the Bible, how language works, biblical images, the nature and limitations of theology, and changing understandings of reality in the search for those paths.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The primary mission of the Bible teacher is to help people feel at home in the Bible. Most people know little bits and pieces of the Bible and can quote a few verses from various passages, but often there is little understanding of the central concerns and the overarching story of the Bible. This little book is intended to help Christians move toward that understanding and discover their identity and mission as the people of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />

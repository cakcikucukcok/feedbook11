  <title>Lao Zi Philosophy of Liberal Government - Prof. Chung Boon Kuan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Professor Chung is one of the few authors who have given a different perspective to original ideas of Lao Zi given in Tao Te Jing. Tao Te Jing is a book on philosophy of governance. For example, verse 31 is talking about the danger of having military forces but yet various authors tried to portray Tao Te Jing as a book on spiritual philosophy or even religious bible. Based on the philosophy of Lao Zi, Professor Chung is trying to give his views that everybody has to educate himself, become self-reliant instead of being fooled into complete dependency on a leader and choose freedom over being protected within a cell.  Prof. Chuah Hean Teik, President of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia 
Many of us have not realized that Taoism is very different from Taoist teachings founded by Lao Zi. In Taoism, Lao Zi is popularly regarded as a god. Ironically Taoist teaching taught by Lao Zi is explicitly an atheist philosophy which is meant to guide us through the treacherous paths in life. This invaluable set of knowledge is encrypted in classical Chinese which is not easily interpreted by an average Chinese reader. In our Malaysian society most of us are better versed in English than Chinese. Professor BK Chung has recognized this setback and with his magnanimous heart, he has taken a lot of pain translating this Chinese script into English, and supplemented with many real-life examples to demonstrate the aptness of Taoist teachings in modern context.  Lim Hock Seng, former R&amp;D Manager of Sony Electronics, Penang 
Our minds, known to us, are not wise but full with defiled thoughts. We have very little idea about our true minds. Tao Te Jing helps us to realize our true minds. This can be achieved by letting go all our conventional ideas, definitions, knowledge, and names. Shortly speaking, we have to let go all our thoughts. All the points highlighted in Tao Te Jing are helping and telling us to detach all the thoughts including the Way (Tao) and Names (Ming).  Dr. Lim Yun Seng, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman
&quot;In a reader friendly style, the authors has translated, interpreted and applied the principles of the philosophy of Tao De Jing succinctly from the perspective of how the government should administer its people and society.  The author in accordance with the philosophy of Tao De Jing, advocates non intervention of the government in peoples lives, society and let nature takes its own course.  A must read for those who wished to be enlightened by the Great Tao of which the author has done a good job in helping us to understand the precepts and basic tenets of the philosophy of Tao De Jing in simple language  and clarity of thoughts.&quot;  Foo Kam Mee, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Creative Industries, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman" />

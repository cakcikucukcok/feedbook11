          &lt;strong&gt;She wants to have this baby alone&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jenna Rawlins is a straitlaced kind of woman. As fate would have it, the one night she goes a little crazy and allows herself to be seduced, she becomes pregnant. It&#39;s bad timing, since she&#39;s trying to claim her independence from her overprotective family, but she&#39;s bound and determined to have this baby–alone. After all, she&#39;s successfully raising two boys by herself after kicking out her good-for-nothing husband. Another baby she can handle. Another man–forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;But he won&#39;t let her&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mark Bishop has discovered Jenna&#39;s condition and wants to be part of his child&#39;s life. But Jenna doesn&#39;t believe the confirmed bachelor is up to the challenge. So she tests him–making him spend time with her boys, showing him what it&#39;s like to be a parent. The problem is, he loves this life that&#39;s been thrown at him–the boys, the child on the way…and Jenna.&lt;/p&gt;

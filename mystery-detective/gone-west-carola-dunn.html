  <title>Gone West - Carola Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A novelist has gone murdered and Daisy Dalrymple investigates-- in a series that&#39;s &quot;pleasantly reminiscent of the old-fashioned English mysteries of a bygone era.&quot; --The Denver Post on&lt;br&gt;Gunpowder Plot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1926, the Honourable Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher visits Sybil Sutherby, a school friend now living in Derbyshire as the confidential secretary to a novelist. Suspecting that something is seriously amiss, Sybil has asked Daisy to discretely investigate. Upon arrival, Daisy finds a household of relatives and would-be suitors living off the hospitality of Humphrey Birtwhistle, who had been supporting them through his thrice-yearly, pseudonymous Westerns. When he took ill, though, Sybil&lt;br&gt;took over writing them while he recovered, only to see the sales increase. Now, she fears that someone in the household is poisoning Birtwhistle to keep him ill and Sybil writing the better-paying versions. But before Daisy can even get decently underway, Humphrey Birtwhistle dies under suspicious circumstances and Daisy now faces a death to untangle, a house full of suspects and a Scotland Yard detective husband who is less than pleased at this turn of events.&lt;/p&gt;" />

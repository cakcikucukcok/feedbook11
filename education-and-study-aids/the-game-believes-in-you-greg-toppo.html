  <title>The Game Believes in You - Greg Toppo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if schools, from the wealthiest suburban nursery school to the grittiest urban high school, thrummed with the sounds of deep immersion? More and more people believe that can happen - with the aid of video games. Greg Toppo&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Game Believes in You&lt;/i&gt; presents the story of a small group of visionaries who, for the past 40 years, have been pushing to get game controllers into the hands of learners. Among the game revolutionaries you&#39;ll meet in this book: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*A game designer at the University of Southern California leading a team to design a video-game version of Thoreau&#39;s Walden Pond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*A young neuroscientist and game designer whose research on &quot;Math Without Words&quot; is revolutionizing how the subject is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;taught, especially to students with limited English abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*A Virginia Tech music instructor who is leading a group of high school-aged boys through the creation of an original opera staged &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;totally in the online game Minecraft. &lt;br&gt;Experts argue that games do truly &quot;believe in you.&quot; They focus, inspire and reassure people in ways that many teachers can&#39;t. Games give people a chance to learn at their own pace, take risks, cultivate deeper understanding, fail and want to try again--right away--and ultimately, succeed in ways that too often elude them in school. This book is sure to excite and inspire educators and parents, as well as provoke some passionate debate.&lt;/p&gt;" />

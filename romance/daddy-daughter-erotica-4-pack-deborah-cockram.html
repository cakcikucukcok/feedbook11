  <title>Daddy-Daughter Erotica 4-Pack - Deborah Cockram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A Blazing Hot Collection of FOUR Scintillating Tales of Daddy-Daughter Lust, Love, &amp;amp; Intimacy that will have you dripping with arousal &amp;amp; desire. Included in this FOUR story bundle are the tales: * Daddy Pounded Me From Behind on Daddy-Daughter Work Day * Daddy &amp;amp; His Partners GANGBANG Me on Daddy-Daughter Work Day * Pounded From the Rear By My Preacher, My DADDY * Disciplined By Daddy &amp;amp; My Teacher. That&amp;#39;s right-4 tales of carnal family lust &amp;amp; desire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve always thought of church as a sacred place, not that I&amp;#39;m necessarily into all the religion and God and heaven and hell beliefs. Hell, I don&amp;#39;t know what I believe, really, other than when I was growing up church was a different place, special. Sometimes I&amp;#39;d go to the sanctuary before most people got there, and it was always so still, so calm, so cool inside, a sense of quiet reverence and I always felt like this is where God was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s what the preacher &amp;ndash; my Daddy &amp;ndash; always said. This was a house of God, sanctified, set aside special for Him, a place to worship and serve him, as if the bricks and mortar and wood used in building the structure, and furniture and ornaments inside, were made of some sort of heavenly material placed on earth by the very hand of God, to be used only for his House.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, though, there&amp;#39;s nothing particularly still or reverent going on in the sanctuary and I feel hot, the burning fire of lust and arousal and desire coursing through my body, sweat covering my skin as I lean over the prayer bench, my bare breasts bouncing, my tender nipples grazing the hard wooden rail along the top of the bench, as my pastor &amp;ndash; my Daddy -- continues thrusting hard, pounding away at me from behind, his cock filling me, stretching me, every muscle in my body contracting with orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I look up at the stained glass in the alcove behind the preacher&amp;#39;s pulpit, the multi-colored image of Christ there, a bearded figure, his face peaceful, serene, hands extended as if welcoming me. Just then Daddy rams so much harder and deeper, his body tensing, trembling, and I scream, from down deep inside me I scream, a primal cry of shame and questioning and wonder, but most of all a cry of intense, deep sexual pleasure as the hardest, deepest orgasm I&amp;#39;ve ever known grips every single muscle in my body, nerves throughout my body on fire.&lt;br /&gt;
I close my eyes, lower my head, hanging over the prayer bench now, the hard wood pressing painfully against my oh-so-tender nipples, Daddy&amp;#39;s hands on my hips and ass, holding me, as he pounds away, his cock inside me, waves of orgasm rocketing through my body. God, is this what sex is usually like? I&amp;#39;ve never felt anything like this before, my body trembling, lungs burning in a vain attempt to keep up with my body&amp;#39;s demand for more oxygen, my heart slamming inside my chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not that I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of experience. I don&amp;#39;t know, maybe all orgasms are supposed to be like this. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just because of where we are &amp;ndash; in the church sanctuary, just below the very pulpit my Daddy preaches from every Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;m of legal age. I&amp;#39;m 19, I guess that makes this all right, doesn&amp;#39;t it? Two consenting adults?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I needed this, deserved this, I suppose..." />

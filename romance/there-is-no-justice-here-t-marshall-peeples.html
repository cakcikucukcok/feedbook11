  <title>There Is No Justice Here - T. Marshall Peeples</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Senior Engineer Mitchell Pierce has been given the task of solving the grisly murders of regional leaders of the LGBT community. When a friend gets targeted as the next victim of the homicidal maniac known only as the Grim Reaper, Mitchell puts into use a highly classified, top-secret project called the Mer Time Machine. When fully constructed, the Mer will be able to transport Mitchell hours or days into the future to observe, investigate, and stop crimes of this nature. Now that hes rushed to use the Mer before it is formally approved for use, he has found that it is subject to malfunction and will send him spiraling to the past. This time, he finds himself in 1892 at Memphis, Tennessee, where he comes face to face with southern justice: Lynching.
Mitchell races against time to save lives in Memphis without changing the course of history. He must also get the Mer to function properly to save the life of one of todays prominent leaders of the LGBT community. Subliminally smitten by his attractive assistant, Antonia Fuentes, Mitchell works hard to hide his emotions while working closely with her on the Mers completion. The tension and suspense boils over when the hunter becomes the hunted in his quest for romance and social justice for all!" />

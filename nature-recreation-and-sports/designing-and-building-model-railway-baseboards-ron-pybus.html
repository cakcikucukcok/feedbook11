  <title>Designing and Building Model Railway Baseboards - Ron Pybus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Model railway baseboards are like the foundations of a house, and failure to build a rigid baseboard that has no movement will inevitably lead to problems. Accordingly, this invaluable, well-illustrated book is essential reading for all those who wish to be guided through the potential pitfalls of making a baseboard and who require practical information about the different kinds of boards and how to construct them properly. It describes in detail how to build several different types of baseboard from the simple box frame, through the monocoque flat board, the drop board and insulation board, to multi-level boards and the helix. With the less adept modeller in mind, the author also explains how to make a baseboard with only a drill, a screwdriver and glue. Essential reading for all modellers of all abilities who want to learn how to overcome the potential pitfalls of making a baseboard and brimming with helpful tips and practical advice. Fully illustrated with 377 step-by-step colour photographs." />

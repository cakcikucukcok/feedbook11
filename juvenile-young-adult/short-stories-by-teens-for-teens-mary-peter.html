  <title>Short Stories by Teens for Teens - Mary Peter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Short Stories by Teens for Teens: Volume 3 takes the reader through journeys based on the opulent imaginations of young people who try to capture their perceptions of what would be like to live in worlds populated with non-earthlings in strange lands. Volume 3 comprises of four interesting stories with adventure, suspense, and excitements written by teens. Mistaken Identity sets the stage for an intriguing and exciting adventure through the book. The story starts off with a young man named Ron who is hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital. He retells the story about his most uneventful experience. 
Jumper 2 is about a doctor named Chuck Jones who happens to buy an apple from a gypsy woman after performing one of the most difficult brain operations. Dr. Jones discovers that the apple has magical powers. Dr. Jones finds himself shrank to the one hundred times his size and now placed in one of his medical books. Dr. Jones struggles to find his way back to his bed. Eventually, he succeeds in jumping back to the floor of his bedroom and back in his bed. After sharing his experience with his son, they both feel it will be adventurous to travel through the story in his sons storybook. They both jump into the story book.
In Marshall the Martian, how would you like to learn about what life is like on Mars? For a Martian named Marshall, life turns out to be way harder than he expected it to be. Marshall is not a very popular guy in Martian Ville. He doesnt have many family members or many friends. And although he owns the Martian Ville Deli, he rarely makes much money because he doesnt have many customers. It isnt going to get any better for our friend Marshall.
In Plotting Revenge Is Fun, Nedara stands on the corner of the block, waiting for that rusty old streetlight to change. Its been broken for a while now. What kind of streetlight gets stuck on yellow for two minutes? Honestly, the second most hated thing in my life has to be that stupid streetlight." />

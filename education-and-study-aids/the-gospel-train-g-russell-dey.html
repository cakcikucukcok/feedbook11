  <title>The Gospel Train - G. Russell Dey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gospel Train left the station long, long ago filled with believers traveling on a straight, resolute track toward an eternal, spiritual paradise. But along the way, different cars of believers were switched off the main track and are now traveling in a somewhat different direction. Even though they are now following many different sets of rails, they all believe they are on the only true path that will take them to their desired destination. This book reveals the ways in which different religions deviated from a common trunk into contrary, discordant branches that are now essentially at war with one another.
     The book focuses on what Christian Bibles actually say instead of what believers are told they say. It gives an accurate account of religious history from verifiable documents that are both ancient and up-to-date records from many different sources. The most tantalizing revelation is the nature of God as stated directly from Christian Bibles. Readers are encouraged to use their own Bibles to verify all references to scripture. Both chapter and verse are supplied for reference purposes.
     After reading this book, you will never again feel exactly the same way about your religion." />

  <title>Serving the Servant - Danny Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONAL BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the twenty-fifth anniversary of Kurt Cobain&amp;#8217;s death comes a new perspective on one of the most compelling icons of our time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early 1991, top music manager Danny Goldberg agreed to take on Nirvana, a critically acclaimed new band from the underground music scene in Seattle. He had no idea that the band&amp;#8217;s leader, Kurt Cobain, would become a pop-culture icon with a legacy arguably at the level of that of John Lennon, Michael Jackson, or Elvis Presley. Danny worked with Kurt from 1990 to 1994, the most impactful period of Kurt&amp;#8217;s life. This key time saw the stratospheric success of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Nevermind, which&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;turned Nirvana into the most successful rock band in the world and made punk and grunge household terms; Kurt&amp;#8217;s meeting and marriage to the brilliant but mercurial Courtney Love and their relationship that became a lightning rod for critics; the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean; and, finally, Kurt&amp;#8217;s public struggles with addiction, which ended in a devastating suicide that would alter the course of rock history. Throughout, Danny stood by Kurt&amp;#8217;s side as manager, and close friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on Goldberg&amp;#8217;s own memories of Kurt, files that previously have not been made public, and interviews with, among others, Kurt&amp;#8217;s close family, friends, and former bandmates, &lt;em&gt;Serving the Servants&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;sheds an entirely new light on these critical years. Casting aside the common obsession with the angst and depression that seemingly drove Kurt, &lt;em&gt;Serving the Servants&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is an exploration of his brilliance in every aspect of rock and roll, his compassion, his ambition, and the legacy he wrought&amp;#8212;one that has lasted decades longer than his career did. Danny Goldberg explores what it is about Kurt Cobain that still resonates today, even with a generation who wasn&amp;#8217;t alive until after Kurt&amp;#8217;s death. In the process, he provides a portrait of an icon unlike any that has come before.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Resisting the Hero - Cindi Madsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Faith Fitzpatrick isn&#39;t looking for a hero. Burned one too many times in the past, she&#39;s now sworn them off completely. And when her brother&#39;s best friend, Connor, convinces him to join the dangerous SWAT team, Faith has never been more anti-hero. What&#39;s wrong with having a &lt;i&gt;safe&lt;/i&gt; job? There&#39;s nothing safe about Connor. Confident, sexy, and sporting a six-pack that should be illegal, he&#39;s everything she doesn&#39;t want. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his best friend&#39;s sister moves to town, local cop Connor Maguire knows he&#39;s in trouble. Faith is feisty, funny, and talks trash like nobody&#39;s business. She&#39;s also his partner&#39;s sister--and so totally off limits. Working on the Fall Festival together, they agree to a truce and become friends. But the more time Connor spends with Faith, the more he&#39;s willing to risk the wrath of her brother. If he could only convince her to take a risk on him, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Accidentally in Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Falling for Her Fiance&lt;br&gt;* Act Like You Love Me&lt;br&gt;* An Officer and a Rebel (novella)&lt;br&gt;* Resisting the Hero&lt;/p&gt;" />

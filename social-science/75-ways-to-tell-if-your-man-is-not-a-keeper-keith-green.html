  <title>75 Ways To Tell if Your Man is NOT a Keeper - Keith Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ladies, ladies, ladies what can I say!? You meet this guy and you think he&#39;s the one, the keeper. He make promises and swears that he will never do you wrong. But in the back of your mind you know something isn&#39;t right with his story. He told you not to worry but you knew you had to. He told you that his word was good but how many times it wasn&#39;t. You heard it all before from your previous husband or boyfriend. You heard the stories so many times before from one or more of your girlfriends about how her man she thought was a keeper turned out to be anything but.  My book isn&#39;t rocket science but it can help you navigate through some of the nonsense. If your man is a keeper he will not let you walk the long walk by yourself. If your man is a keeper he will meet you halfway all the time. If your man is a keeper he will always put you first and foremost. If your man is a keeper you will always have a smile on your face when you think of him. Enjoy my book ladies and stay tuned for my next book." />

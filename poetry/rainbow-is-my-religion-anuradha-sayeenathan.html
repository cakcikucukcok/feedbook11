  <title>Rainbow Is My Religion - Anuradha Sayeenathan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Someone somewhere told we should become a child when we are writing for children. I have tried to reflect a childs imagination in this collection. It is my son who led me back to my innocent days. I should admit I am enjoying the second childhood thoroughly.
Most of the poems in this book happened during our stay in California. It was a new world, new culture, new trees, and new flowers. I admired them all with a childs heart. I used to be an active volunteer in a public school there, and this threw light on the likes and dislikes of children from around the globe. I should be thankful to the school authorities and teachers for the priceless opportunity.
Rainbow Is My Religion has enough doses of fun and entertainment for boys and girls alike. I can assure that the older kids in the family called parents will enjoy this book equally.
Happy reading!" />

  <title>Warawiri - Andreas Gosana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is meant literally! Join the group of five who get lost in a Warawiri, back-and-forth time travel journey into the Middle Age kingdom of Demak Jepara, in the island of Java in the sixteenth-century CE, and explore the amazing experiences of five hundred years ago in a mystical tropical kingdom. An East Timorese businessman, a Japanese stockbroker, a German music anthropologist, and a young Javanese executive lady are in the possession of heirlooms of the Middle Age Javanese kingdom, and they are transported by the mystical powers five centuries back because the heirlooms need to be spiritually cleansed. The president of the United States was also among the victims of the time travel into the past. 
And if you do not possess any ancient heirlooms, then just join the ninety-thousand spectator crowds on the soccer championship in the Jakarta Senayan gigantic stadium, who are also transported like a giant flying saucer five centuries into the past.
The only way to rescue the victims back into the present is by holding a mystical ceremony from eight skyscrapers rooftops surrounding the stadium by eight spiritual masters forming the Mandala star configurations, playing the sacred Javanese gending symphony, the Harmony of Spirit in the Sky, led by their leader from the location of the lost stadium, using a slate board as his iPad.
The events are all covered by Matra TV, a private TV broadcast company. A colorful laser light show in the sky from the skyscrapers rooftops, a rumor of an affair involving the president of the United States and the Javanese executive, and an exotic, mystical witchcraft ceremony and village life in remote jungle of Borneo add to your colorful journey into the past." />

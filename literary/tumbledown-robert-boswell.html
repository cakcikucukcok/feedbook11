He&#39;s in line for a big promotion at Onyx Springs, the treatment facility where he&#39;s a therapist. He has a fiancée, a sizable house, and a Porsche.&lt;br&gt;     But . . . he&#39;s falling in love with another woman, he&#39;s underwater on his mortgage, and he&#39;s put his hapless best friend in charge of his signature therapeutic program. Even the GPS on his car can&#39;t seem to predict where he should turn next. And his clients are struggling in their own hilarious, heartbreaking ways to keep their lives on track. How can he help them if he can&#39;t help himself?&lt;br&gt;     In &lt;i&gt;Tumbledown&lt;/i&gt;, Robert Boswell presents a large, unforgettable cast of characters who are all failing and succeeding in various degrees to make sense of our often-irrational world. In a moving narrative twist, he boldly reckons with the extent to which tragedy can be undone, the impossible accommodated.&lt;/p&gt;" />

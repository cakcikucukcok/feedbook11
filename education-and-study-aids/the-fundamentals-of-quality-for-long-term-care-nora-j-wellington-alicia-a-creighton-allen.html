As the saying goes, Your facility must be survey-ready 365 days a year. So use this book to help you get readyand stay ready. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Fundamentals of Quality for LTC, Part I gives you the F-Tags, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Interpretive Guidelines and Guidance to Surveyors. This is a comprehensive monitoring tool for all disciplines to use in an interdisciplinary format. It covers the Federal Long Term Care Regulations 42 CFR 483.10 Resident Rights through 483.20 Resident Assessment. Because this is such a practical tool, it is a book that staff will keep handy at their desks to use for monitoring purposes and for quick reference. It will help the Interdisciplinary Team (IDT)including one of the most important and busiest groups, the Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) maintain awareness of the expectations of the Federal and State Surveyors. It will also keep the staffs focus on Quality of Care and Quality of Life. &lt;/p&gt;" />

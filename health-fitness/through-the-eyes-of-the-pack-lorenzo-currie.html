  <title>Through the Eyes of the Pack - Lorenzo Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the real deal nowI am not trying to persuade anyone or change their minds. I am simply telling the truth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside on the forgotten and taboo cultural history and the forgotten art of respect for one another and the inside views and explanations of people of mixed heritages and their life encounters, how other ethnic groups treat one another, and how they think of other groups in society. The ugly truth about man and prejudice as well as how to love and accept other cultures, what to do with your mixed childs hair and skin care products, as well as important people in each of the main cultures of whites, blacks, Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics. People you never heard of that made great contributions to our present day world, as well as women who, against the odds of man, contributed greatly to our present-day society. Women who were told not to do so, but they did it with determination and courage! Experience the hidden secret of each culture that can only be shared and protected by that culture as a group. A glossary of the meanings of words in the book, as well as every ethnic derogatory word from A to Z.&lt;/p&gt;" />

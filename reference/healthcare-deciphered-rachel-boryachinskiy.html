  <title>Healthcare Deciphered - Rachel Boryachinskiy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Healthcare is frustrating, complicated, and overall boring. However, much like the buying any item on the market today, if you do not do your research, you could be left paying thousands more than necessary. You have to take an active role to prevent overspending! The only way to own your experience is to have a degree in healthcare currently. 
This book prevents the need for higher education, breaking down the industry into a handbook for success. By applying a few steps, everyone can decrease the amount paid on everything from doctor visits to large hospital bills. In addition, we help provide undisclosed secrets about your health insurance company. 
I know all the intrigue details, you cannot find anywhere on the Internet. To be honest, most of the specifics mentioned in the book are not even taught at the graduate level. You have to be in the industry. 
The best part is Im telling you now. Its time to start really explaining how health plans work. We need to be able as familiar with healthcare bills, as we are with our everyday utility bills. I guarantee if the cable bill goes up, you notice. I know I do. This is the reason Im creating a handbook and helping unlock the answers to all the questions you never knew to ask. How could you? You dont have a degree in healthcare, nor do you want one. Instead you can use my education and experience to navigate the industry like a pro. Lets get started." />

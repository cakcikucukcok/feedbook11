  <title>Watercolor Techniques: Painting Light and Color in Landscapes and Cityscapes - Michael Reardon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;No other medium is as magical and enjoyable as watercolor.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So says artist and author Michael Reardon. In &lt;i&gt;Watercolor Techniques: Painting Light and Color in Landscapes and Cityscapes&lt;/i&gt;, Reardon covers it all, from answers to beginners&amp;#39; most vexing problems (What is the proper ratio of pigment and water? How do I lay down an even wash? Why do my paintings look so washed out?) to understanding the trifecta of perspective, value, and color. He shows how to paint whites that sparkle and shadows that glow and how to conjure the atmosphere of a particular place and time. Painters of all skill levels will see--&lt;i&gt;and feel&lt;/i&gt;--the difference in their work.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Packed with expert advice for infusing scenes with light and color&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes special tips and techniques for painting architectural subjects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrated with inspiring paintings of scenes from around the world&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 start-to-finish demonstrations show key concepts in action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;quot;Light, as it glances off a facade, glimmers off the water or gleams off polished marble, is always inspiring. Color, with its infinite array of hues, is always irresistible. Searching for ways to make them harmonize and tell a story can last a lifetime.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />

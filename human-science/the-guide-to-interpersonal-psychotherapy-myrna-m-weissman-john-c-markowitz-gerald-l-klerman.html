  <title>The Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy - Myrna M. Weissman, John C. Markowitz, Gerald L. Klerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;The Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy&lt;/em&gt; is the definitive, practical guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for clinicians and researchers. IPT is a well-researched, time-limited, and diagnosis-focused therapy. An update and expansion of the original 1984, 2000, and 2007 IPT manuals, this guide illustrates not only individual IPT treatment for patients with major depression but also adaptations of IPT for different diagnoses, patient populations, and treatment formats. This book is the basis for the extensive research that has validated IPT and led to its listing in treatment guidelines.
Written by the originators of the treatment and one of its leading researchers, this updated and expanded guide describes how to approach clinical encounters with patients, how to focus IPT treatment, and how to handle therapeutic difficulties. IPT can be combined with medication, and it is a safe alternative to medication for individuals who may not be able to take antidepressants. IPT has been shown not only to relieve symptoms but to build social skills as well. Learn how to use IPT to effectively treat depression and other disorders including bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress, and borderline personality disorder. With clinical examples and sample therapist scripts throughout, &lt;em&gt;The Guide&lt;/em&gt; summarizes the theoretical and empirical background of IPT and focuses on teaching you the best way to deliver this effective, immensely practical treatment." />

  <title>A Ghost of Che - Mauktik Kulkarni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;...The reader departs with the narrator from Louisville and accompanies him on his route, which takes him from Peru, through Argentina and Chile, on his return through Peru and eventually on his return to Louisville, Kentucky.  However, the human side of the story that occurs with the narrator, in fact the most outstanding part of the story, does not follow as linear a path as the trip on which Kulkarni embarks through the areas of South America.  In fact, what stands out most in the text is the mastery of narration that catches the reader from the first page and never lets go.  One continues reading because one wants to (needs to, in fact) know what will happen next.  The plot contrasts the trip through geographic points, the ponderings and reflections of Mauktik along his trip and his retrospective vision of his life.  The result is fascinating.  All of it awakens our attention...&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
...The book is a cultural/anthropological study that permits us access to the perspective of a person coming from another culture disparate from that of Latin America, a non-North American vision of our people and our customs.  What&#39;s fascinating is that the narrator does not speak Spanish fluently; a reader that has a command of both languages quickly notes the linguistic errors.  However, one immediately recognizes that the value and purpose of the book goes far beyond linguistic conventions.  A Ghost of Che explores the human condition, as told by a narrator who travels thousands of kilometers in search of the unknown and who ends up finding himself; in the process, he discovers the goodness of people.  Probably, the best tribute that one could make to the book would be to say that the reader wants to embark on a similar journey after reading it.&quot;&lt;p&gt;

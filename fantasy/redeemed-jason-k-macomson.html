  <title>Redeemed - Jason K Macomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eric, Will, and Carol are on the run after being exiled by Demetrius, the new Master of the vampires in Strongfield.  Following the showdown with the coven, the three have been warned not to return, and Carol has been declared dead in official police reports.  Facing an uncertain future, Carol reluctantly joins Eric and Will, but she is uncertain if she can leave her old life behind and embrace Will&#39;s faith.  Along the way, a physical attraction develops between Will and Carol as he teaches her about the Way and what it means to become a servant of The Name.  Carol resists at first, but through a series of encounters, she develops a newfound respect for faith in God.  When she insists on returning to Boston, however, events are set in motion which threaten all their lives.  The trio is forced on the run again, fleeing vampires sent from Strongfield to capture them.  A life-and-death struggle culminates in a crossroads for Carol, who must finally make a choice about whom she will serve." />

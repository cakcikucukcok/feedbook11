      <meta name="description" content="The world is sharply divided by national and cultural borders. The world is full of dangerous monsters, wars, famine, and division. The worlds people, desperate for a solution to a problem lasting hundreds of years, finally start working together by forming the first world union.
A retired military captain, Michael Zikovitz, is called upon to service his nation one last time as a delegate to the World Union. He comes to a beautiful castle, built to be the base of the Union, to an unfamiliar environment and is forced to fight for his respect and interests.
He has to work with people from around, and even beyond, the world to come up with solutions to the worlds issues. They have to find a way to work together to fight against enemies of the world and to keep themselves together." />

  <title>Destiny&#39;s Chosen - Amanda Alexander, Samantha Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two years after their first trip to Viguanagura, Courtney and Rebecca have trouble adapting to normal life. While home for Christmas break, the sisters find the magical mirror that originally transported them to the enchanting world and are once again caught up in a fantastical adventure. Restoration after the revolution is still in progress, but along with these many changes comes a new problem. Girls are being kidnapped from the villages. While trying to help catch the kidnapper, Rebecca herself is taken captive along with her friend Jennifer. The only clue to the identity of the kidnapper is his unnerving yellow eyes. 
 While Courtney embarks on a quest to rescue her sister, many more unsettling things surface about the dark past of Viguanagura, all of which seem to revolve around the illusive kidnapper. The prophecy once again becomes entangled in her life, and she discovers the harrowing truth about who her parents really are. As she struggles to find herself, she realizes that the truth doesnt always need to be uncovered." />

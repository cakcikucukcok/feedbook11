  <title>A Roaring Girl - H. A. Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The surreal life and bizarre times of a college-educated career call girl.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A brave new look at the oldest profession, A Roaring Girl is, without a doubt, the most unusual book of its kind ever written. Part edgy, x-rated memoir; part sex-positive, pro-prostitution polemic, H. A. Carson&#39;s 400-plus page interview with an anonymous &quot;escort&quot; known as &quot;The Thinking Man&#39;s Hooker,&quot; is an unflinchingly honest presentation of one woman&#39;s professional life and &lt;EM&gt;Weltanshaung&lt;/EM&gt; in all its sordid/surreal, gonzo/glamorous glory. From start to finish, the book is, much like the subject herself, intelligent, outrageous, relentlessly &quot;in your face,&quot; and utterly unique. A Roaring Girl presents a prostitute who is neither gilded angel nor fallen victim nor pseudo-sexy, &quot;nymphomaniacal&quot; sophisticate. She is the sex worker as female outlaw/entrepreneur; the prostitute as world-class iconoclast. Perhaps most intriguing of all, A Roaring Girl lays bare the surreal world of pay-for-play psychopathia sexualis with humor and compassion as well as the unflinchingly analytical insight of a &quot;happy hooker&quot; swapping stories with Kinsey or Havelock Ellis. Raw, irreverent, visceral, disturbing, and funny, &lt;U&gt;A&lt;/U&gt; &lt;U&gt;Roaring Girl&lt;/U&gt; is, above all, a &quot;roaring&quot; good read! It is astonishingly literate, unabashedly erotic; flawlessly analytical; shockingly explicit, and surprisingly (and often darkly) humorous. Carson&#39;s mystery woman turns a phrase as effortlessly and asexpertly as she formerly turned tricks. Whatever else can be said of her, the whore can write. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A Roaring Girl is a revolutionary work. It is also fascinating, You will try, unsuccessfully, to put it down. &lt;/P&gt;" />

  <title>Wilderness Spirituality - Rodney Romney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book about wilderness spirituality. It is not a manual about how to worship in the woods or find salvation through nature. It is a book about a certain kind of belief and faith that can transform the wilderness of life from arenas of confusion and fear into places of emancipation and hope. It is a book for all of us, because we all share a piece of the same wilderness. - RRR
Idaho Sawtooth Mountains
Rod was the greatest of the great gifts given to me, and we had an extraordinary life together. I will forever love him for the beauty of his spirit and open-hearted faith that he shared with such loving-kindness - always.
I will always treasure the calmness of Rods last days with me by his side, with no intrusion or extreme measures - dressed by me, his very dearest, in his comfy jammies and a very simple burial.
Rod cherished the final wilderness, his own death, and approached it with sublime gratitude and absolute peace. In death I have grown to know Rod in new ways, through the union of our spirits that is everlasting.

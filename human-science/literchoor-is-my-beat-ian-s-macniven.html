  <title>&quot;Literchoor Is My Beat&quot; - Ian S. MacNiven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A biography--thoughtful and playful--of the man who founded New Directions and transformed American publishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Laughlin--poet, publisher, world-class skier--was the man behind some of the most daring, revolutionary works in verse and prose of the twentieth century. As the founder of New Directions, he published Ezra Pound&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Cantos&lt;/i&gt; and William Carlos Williams&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Paterson&lt;/i&gt;; he brought Hermann Hesse and Jorge Luis Borges to an American audience. Throughout his life, this tall, charismatic intellectual, athlete, and entrepreneur preferred to stay hidden. But no longer--in &lt;i&gt;&quot;Literchoor Is My Beat&quot;: A Life of James Laughlin, Publisher of New Directions&lt;/i&gt;, Ian S. MacNiven has given us a sensitive and revealing portrait of this visionary and the understory of the last century of American letters.&lt;br&gt;     Laughlin--or J, as MacNiven calls him--emerges as an impressive and complex figure: energetic, idealistic, and hardworking, but also plagued by doubts--not about his ability to identify and nurture talent but about his own worth as a writer. Haunted by his father&#39;s struggles with bipolar disorder, J threw himself into a flurry of activity, pulling together the first New Directions anthology before he&#39;d graduated from Harvard and purchasing and managing a ski resort in Utah.&lt;br&gt;     MacNiven&#39;s portrait is comprehensive and vital, spiced with Ezra Pound&#39;s eccentric letters, J&#39;s romantic foibles, and anecdotes from a seat-of-your-pants era of publishing now gone by. A story about the struggle to publish only the best, it is itself an example of literary biography at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;" />

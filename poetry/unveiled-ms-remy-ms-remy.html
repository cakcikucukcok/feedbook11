  <title>Unveiled - Ms. Remy, Ms. Remy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unveiled, is a Poetic Portal N2 Life through Love, Lust, Pain and deceit. This anthology of adult poems contours the strengths and weaknesses of relationships. It 
distorts what seems real and makes a fantasy pure reality. My expressions are pure and 
simple with a twist. These poetic verses take on a life of their own and invite you to 
become a part of them. It will intoxicate your mind and free your spirit. It will take you into life, and touch on topics that most would not speak of.  It leads you through lustful actions, allowing the flesh to lead; with no communication with the mind. Once the lust burns out it will then lead to pain. The feelings and experiences of pain leave a feeling of agony that cuts through to the bone.  After pulling through the painful experiences, you are in a mist of confusion; thus leading you to search for the ultimate feeling. Love has no name, no protocol, no right or wrong way, its just love.  Once you have experienced true lust, and real pain, you will understand that; you must live life to the fullest and be happy with your decisions. Love becomes the most dominant feeling and it transforms you, it changes the way you walk, you talk, you dress, it evens changes your way of writing.  Layer by layer it all comes off, revealing the most inner thoughts and experiences, I give you, Unveiled!" />

Not the US Army, in this army I had to wear at all times the full armor of God so that I can stand against the evil&#39;s schemes. This war was not with flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. When I enlisted in this army I had no idea that I would ever have to go to the battle field, but the more I learned the more powerful the enemy became. Now I&#39;m face to face with the enemy and the forces are mighty. Even with the whole armor on; the enemy started to attack my mind through other who are in the same war but, are not fully dress for battle. I&#39;ve lost some friends along the way so I keep reminding myself it&#39;s not my battle and the war is already won. This war is not with the enemy outside the camp but within, people who are suppose to be fighting for the same cause. I have seen so many friends leave this war only because they forgot who is in charge and he has never lost a battle! In spite of what people might be saying about me I&#39;m a hard fighting solider and I&#39;m going to keep climbing up the King&#39;s Highway.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />

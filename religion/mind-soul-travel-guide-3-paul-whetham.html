  <title>Mind &amp; Soul Travel Guide 3 - Paul Whetham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tired of small talk? Drawing on the latest neuroscience research and great Christian thinkers, Dr Whetham puts forward a persuasive argument that it is time to build a bridge between the mind and soul. This 3rd travel guide looks at Christian spirituality and why honest, ongoing conversations with God and others is food for the mind and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soul Food Cafe&amp;rsquo;s three Mind &amp;amp; Soul Travel Guides are designed to renew your mind and soul. We lead you on an adventure using &amp;lsquo;tell, show, do&amp;rsquo; education principles. In Travel Guide 1 we tell you about the 3 levels of existence using existentialism (Aesthetic, Ethical, Religious/Spiritual), the 3 minds in neuroscience (Chaotic, Contemplative, Compassionate) and propose a DSM guide for the soul (Despair, Suffering, Meaning). In Travel Guide 2 we show you the journey of discovery using personal insights and the psychology of meaning-making. In Travel Guide 3 we draw on some of the great Christian thinkers to help you move from old way to new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Mind and Soul Travel Guide series (3 books) accompany the Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; online courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; is an organisation who aims to promote spiritual health as a pathway to mental health. At Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; we believe it is possible to find beauty, meaning and purpose in a seemingly broken world. And our soul is tough and tenacious enough to find it. We provide a safe space for stories, skills and support to flourish. By exploring how our smaller story intersects with our soul story we give voice to the deeper things of the mind and soul that will help you to thrive, not just survive. The basic idea of Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; is to transform existing community caf&amp;eacute;s into informal sacred spaces where we reflect, connect and grow with others. Our caf&amp;eacute;s are also community training spaces where we use three core courses to deepen our self-awareness, spirituality and listening skills, to assist others who are soul searching. We take you on a journey of discovery where you will be coached by others and, in turn, become a coach to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We offer a number of well-being resources that are designed to renew your mind and soul:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Mind &amp;amp; Soul Travel Guides (3 Books): 1. Journey of Discovery, 2. Built for Adventure, 3. Soul Talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Journey of Discovery Courses: 1. Self-Discovery, 2. Shared Discovery, 3. Discovery Coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Optional Courses: 1. Retrain My Brain, 2. Brain-Based Resilience Training, 3. Soul Searching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;strong&gt;www.soulfood.cafe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

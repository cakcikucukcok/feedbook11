  <title>Finally Thinking with the Right Head - R. T. Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being a young man can be difficultresisting temptation, facing challenges at every turn to prove your manhood, and dealing with the torment of your natural desires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author R. T. Ellis is the first to admit that he didnt always make the best decisions. Here, he shares his lust-filled and hormone-fueled past in raging detail, hoping to inspire others to learn from his mistakes. Acting out of lust instead of using his heart or brain put him in some dangerous situations. Some nearly cost him his life, while others threatened his freedom and future. Often brutally honest, his story takes readers deep into his past adventuressome he himself describes as good, others as bad, and more still as downright disgraceful, degrading, demeaning, and disgusting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At his core, he now knows, is a crippling lack of self-esteem and respect for himself and his sexual partners. Somewhere along the line, the immature boy has grown into an introspective man who needs to share his story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father of three, R. T. is trying to move beyond the misadventures of his past. It is for his children that he has come face to face with his history; in his story, others may see themselvesand the future that awaits.&lt;/p&gt;" />

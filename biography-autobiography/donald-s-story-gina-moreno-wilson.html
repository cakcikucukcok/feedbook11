  <title>Donald’S Story - Gina Moreno Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;With heart-wrenching honesty, Donalds Story chronicles the last days and years &lt;br /&gt;of one familys drama through the hell which is Alzheimers dementia. This story will make you cry, make you laugh, and make you think. Its a must read for anyone who will ever get old  particularly for &lt;br /&gt;anyone who may one day be a caregiver, an AD patient, or a supportive family member of the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suffering wreaked from terminal dementia is a saga which is becoming all too familiar. As the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S., Alzheimers and related dementing illnesses are epidemic. How do you survive this disease which robs you of your very self? How do you survive watching someone you love slip away? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with &quot;AD Survival Tips&quot;, Donalds Story is not just a memoir. It is also a planning tool and a survival guide for dementia families, providing a roadmap through the tangled darkness. Still, despite the subject matter, this memoir is not wholly dark. How could it be when it is first and foremost a love story? Loving deeply and forever may render us vulnerable to pain, but therein lies the meaning of life. When all is said and done, Donalds Story is most purely a reminder of just how precious life is.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>The Gulf War Chronicles - Richard S. Lowry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Extensively researched, painstakingly documented, and dedicated to the courageous men and women who fought and served in the First War with Iraq, this is a factual military history of Operation Desert Storm-and the only readable and thorough chronicle of the entire war.&lt;/P&gt;
From the first night of battle to Day Two, when Saddam struck back, to G Day and the eventual cease-fire, accomplished military historian Richard S. Lowry delivers a detailed, day-by-day account of each battle and every military encounter leading up to the liberation of Kuwait.&lt;/P&gt;
Desert Storm was a war of many firsts: America&#39;s first four-dimensional war; the first time in military history that a submerged submarine attacked a land target; the Marine Corps&#39; first combat air strikes from an amphibious assault ship; the first time in the history of warfare that a soldier surrendered to a robot; and more. And it was an overwhelming victory for the United States and its allies.&lt;/P&gt;
Intentionally presented without political commentary and ending with a complete listing of the heroic Americans killed in Desert Storm as well as a battle timeline, glossary, bibliography, and resources, &lt;I&gt;The Gulf War Chronicles&lt;/I&gt; provides a much-needed understanding of the nature of modern-day, high-tech warfare and honors America&#39;s collective resolve and commitment to freedom.&lt;/P&gt;" />

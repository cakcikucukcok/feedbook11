  <title>Being a Parent - Neena Sawant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The last few years has seen a tremendous increase in emotional and behavioral problems in children. Working parents, nuclear family structure, having a single child has made parenting a difficult task. Quality time is what parents are trying to juggle in their daily packed routines. Today parents may not be able to ascertain the various emotional and behavioral problems seen in children. I have tackled a few of these in the school going children like hyperactivity, behavior problems, T.V. addiction etc as well as the problems of the teenagers. Most of the times, these would be considered a part of growing up and not a serious problem.  As a psychiatrist, I do feel that it is my primary duty to enlighten parents, make them aware and help them understand their children." />

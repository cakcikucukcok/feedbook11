        &lt;p&gt;When investigative journalist Natalie McCabe discovers a local investment bank is taking retirees for a ride, she&#39;s all over the case, even going undercover to get the goods on dirty brokers. But then Jason Jamison, the man she recently saw murder his wife, escapes from jail.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And incognito or not, Natalie&#39;s life is in danger. Fortunately her new bodyguard, Vincent Fortune, has the brawn to keep her safe地s long as she plays by &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; rules.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vincent can&#39;t figure out his spitfire client. She wants security, but sneaks away as soon as she thinks she has a lead. All he knows is their attraction is growing stronger each day. And Vincent&#39;s not sure how much longer he can protect Natalie from his own desire.&lt;/p&gt;

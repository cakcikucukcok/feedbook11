  <title>A Small Part of Me - Robert E. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Synopsis
A Small Part of Me
This book is composed of two different parts, which stems from my life experiences. Part one is titled Mixed Emotions and part two is Lifes Daily Trials. 
I use the name Jehovah because Margaret M. Johnson, my beautiful grandmother, spoke of Jehovah every day. Many cultures pray to different names in reference to God. This is the name I heard growing up with a grandmother who singly cared for as many as fourteen children in one household. My wonderful mother, Barbara W. Marsh, taught me its not how well-known you are, its what you do to become well-known. In order to get a friend, you first need to be one. Not all friends turn out to be as true friends as you are to them, but you learn as you go.
Part one is about feelings of the mind, heart, and soul. As we become older, we, in turn, should become wiser. It doesnt happen with everyone because we all sometimes follow when we should lead. In following, I have suffered more than some and less than others, but only Jehovah knows how much either way.
Part two is a compilation of short narratives. The intentions are to strengthen whoever is feeling down about something in their life mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. In time, promoting hope and shedding light on a negative lifestyle. Some of these narratives have changed things in my life that very few people know of today. I hope those that read this book will see that you dont need to go down the wrong path in order to do right. I hope and pray that this book will help you see some things within yourself that could be changed for the better. Each of us have some things that we have been through in life, but the name of the game is survival and education. Jehovah teaches us many things in everyday living, mostly through blessings. Temptation is always going to be there, but its up to each one of us to survive them. We can share our pain with others and hope that they can make a negative decision into a positive one. This book is based on my feelings, my emotions. 
Always trust and have faith in Jehovah not man, whom sometimes try to entice you into doing what you would consider as wrong. Its not worth the heartache and trouble, which you can never take back. Relationships, living, dating, and marriagetheyre not for everyone because not everybody is looking for the same things out of a commitment to one another. Know what you want before you act and how to go about getting it. It involves two souls with the same outlook on life to make things work, its never one-sided. Always be definite about what you want out of life and make it a goal, not a job, to get it.
I hope this will educate and inspire others to speak their truths, reach for their goals, and never settle for less than the best. One should live life to the fullest, just as I have been inspired to do just that. Thank you and God bless.

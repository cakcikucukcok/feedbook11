  <title>Andalucia - Richard W Hardwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When someone you love is diagnosed with cancer, every second you have left with them is precious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard W Hardwick wrote about his partner&amp;#39;s breast cancer to help him cope, and then he wrote about their past because he was scared she might not be there to help him remember it for their children. Andalucia tells the story of a young couple falling in love in the Golan Heights, bathing in the Sea of Galilee, living in the cheapest hostel in Amsterdam&amp;#39;s red-light district and becoming homeless in Greece. Past and present is skilfully woven together to form a unique and beautiful portrait of a family facing the ultimate fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gripping, heart-breaking, raw and inspiring, Andalucia is an unforgettable journey, both geographically and of the soul. It is also a life-affirming celebration of the strength of human spirit, the healing power of nature and the importance of community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#39;Told with courage, humour and love, Andalucia weaves past and present with great skill so the pace of the narrative never falters. There is a zest for life on every page of this book which I found both moving and inspiring&amp;#39; &lt;br&gt;- Pat Barker, winner of the Booker Prize." />

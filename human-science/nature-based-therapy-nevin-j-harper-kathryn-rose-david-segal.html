  <title>Nature-Based Therapy - Nevin J. Harper, Kathryn Rose, David Segal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research published in Psychological Bulletin shows that millennials suffer more from anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts than any other generation, and the number of people seeking help for mental health concerns is growing at an alarming rate  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aligned with this heightened awareness of mental health issues is the need to reconnect with nature, especially as it relates to &quot;unplugging&quot;, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and environmental crises.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature-based Therapy &lt;/em&gt;is a practical guide for those working in educational and therapeutic settings that addresses the disconnection between humans and their ecological home &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The nature-based approach offers offer something unique that addresses the underlying disconnection &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explains successful theories and practices undertaken with children, youth, and families. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing sensory awareness of both outer and inner landscapes, navigating risk in play, and partnering with nature as a co-facilitator to create lasting change are a few of the powerful approaches explored &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case examples include a diverse range of intentions and interventions from one-on-one sessions in forests, group work at local parks, to multi-family outdoor adventures &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is practitioner-friendly and not overly academic  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contains easily understood approaches with rationales and practice examples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Bridges multiple helping and healing fields  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authors have been working in nature-based therapy for over 15 years.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dr. Nevin J. Harper (PhD) is an Associate Professor in the School of Child &amp; Youth Care at the University of Victoria, a National Research Coordinator for Outward Bound Canada, and the co-chair of the Adventure Therapy International Committee.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David Segal (MA, RCC), and Kathryn Rose (MA, RCC) are both Registered Clinical Counselors in a successful private practice that focuses primarily on nature-based therapy for children, youth, families, and groups. &lt;/li&gt;

  <title>Performing Gender and Violence in Contemporary Transnational Contexts - Maria Anita Stefanelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Acknowledgements -- Preface by Maria Anita Stefanelli -- 1. Making Visible. Theatrical Form as Metaphor: Marina Carr and Caryl Churchill by Cathy Leeney -- 2. Obscene Transformations: Violence, Women and Theatre in Sarah Kane and Marina Carr by Melissa Sihra -- 3. Can the Subaltern Dream? Epistemic Violence, Oneiric Awakenings and the Quest for Subjective Duality in Marina Carr&#39;s Marble - Interview with Marina Carr - Excerpt from Marble by Marina Carr by Valentina Rapetti -- 4. &quot;The house is a battlefield now&quot;: War of the Sexes and Domestic Violence in Van Badham&#39;s Kitchen and Warren Adler&#39;s The War of the Roses - Interview with Van Badham - Excerpt from Kitchen by Van Badham by Barbara Miceli -- 5.

Turning Muteness into Performance in Erin Shields&#39; If We Were Birds - Interview with Erin Shields - Excerpt from If We Were Birds by Erin Shields by Maria Anita Stefanelli -- 8. Afterword: Vocal and Verbal Assertiveness by Kate Burke -- Contributors
An extraordinary complexity characterizes the encounter between theatre, mythology, and human rights when gender-based violence is on the platform. Another encounter enhances the cross-disciplinary and transnational dynamics in this book: the one between the scholar and the playwright, who exchange views to pursue a theme demanding due attention at an emergence that needs being explored to be understood and combated, and finally turned into a priority action. Through the analysis of a repertoire of contemporary plays and performance practices from English-speaking countries, the contributors explore in detail the asymmetrical relations that exist between men and women, the crimes involved, and the ways in which the protagonists&#39; minds work differently. The unconventional format adopted for the five central sections that follow two papers centered on Marina Carr&#39;s theatre in comparison with two noteworthy British playwrights&#39;, and that forerun the final stringent remarks about woman&#39;s (like man&#39;s) fundamental right to speak and need for words, offers not just single chapters, however provocative, on an aspect of the theme, but a tripartite session boasting a critical inquiry into the text, the playwright&#39;s response to criticism, and a sample of the author&#39;s creative expression. What emerges is a prismatic, complex, and visceral vision of the plays offered to the public for further elaboration and critique. Beside Carr, those involved are Raquel Almazan, Van Badham, Carolyn Gage and Erin Shields - all of them champions of today&#39;s feminist commitment to denounce, through their art, violence against women." />

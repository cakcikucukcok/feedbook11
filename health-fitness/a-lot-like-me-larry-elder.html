  <title>A Lot Like Me - Larry Elder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Dear Father, Dear Son&lt;/em&gt; is national bestselling author and syndicated radio host Larry Elder&amp;#39;s personal memoir of his troubled ? one might even say tortured ? relationship with his father.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elder writes,&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;A man&amp;#39;s relationship with his father ? every boy, every man lucky enough to have a father in his life has to figure that out. My own father? I thought I knew him ? even though he seldom talked about himself. And what I knew I hated ? really, really hated. Cold, ill-tempered, thin-skinned, my father always seemed on the brink of erupting. Scared to death of him, I kept telling myself to find the courage to &amp;#39;stand up to him.&amp;#39; When I was fifteen, I did.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We did not speak to each other for ten years.... And then we did ? for eight hours.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dear Father, Dear Son&lt;/em&gt; is the powerful story of those eight hours, during which Elder finally confronted his father. It is the story of one extraordinary, all-day conversation between Elder and his long-estranged father that utterly transformed their relationship. It is the&amp;nbsp;story of one man discovering a son he never really knew. And of the son finding a man, a friend, a father who had been there all along." />

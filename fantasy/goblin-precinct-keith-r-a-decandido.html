      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Humans and elves, dwarves and gnomes, wizards and warriors all live and do business in the thriving, overcrowded port city of Cliff&amp;#39;s End, to say nothing of the tourists and travelers who arrive by land and sea, passing through the metropolis on matters of business or pleasure&amp;mdash;or on quests. The hard-working, under-appreciated officers of the Cliff&amp;#39;s End Castle Guard work day and night to maintain law and order as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new drug called Bliss is sweeping across the slums of Goblin Precinct. It makes people feel better&amp;mdash;but if they take too much, they overdose and die. It doesn&amp;#39;t truly become a concern for the Castle Guard until one of the overdoses turns out to be a former elf lord who is wanted for war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Captain of the Guard must put his best detectives, the half-elf Danthres Tresyllione and the ex-soldier Torin ban Wyvald, on the case to find out what happened to the elf. But when the magickal examiner discovers the truth behind Bliss, it becomes a firestorm of controversy that brings the Brotherhood of Wizards into the case&amp;mdash;and that never ends well...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An all-new adventure of the Cliff&amp;#39;s End Castle Guard!&lt;/p&gt;" />

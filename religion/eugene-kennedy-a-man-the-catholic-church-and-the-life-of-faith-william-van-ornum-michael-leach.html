  <title>Eugene Kennedy: A Man, the Catholic Church, and the Life of Faith - William Van Ornum, Michael Leach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For two decades, Eugene Kennedy was one of the church&#39;s fiercest critics in the sexual abuse crisis, with frequent articles in National Catholic Reporter. This book--written as an appreciation by one of Kennedy&#39;s former students at Loyola University of Chicago--recalls and assesses his huge literary output throughout fifty years of active research and writing. Kennedy&#39;s entire career can be seen as an extension of Vatican II. Topics in the tremendous arc of his career include a career-starting book on improving seminaries, inspiring books about faith in the twentieth century, leadership in the 1972 study by United States Catholic bishops, books on how to do counseling at the parish level, ongoing reviews of how the church put Vatican II in motion, and his last book, which is a gentle collection of blogs as he fondly reminisced about his life. In the middle of all this, he was a successful novelist and political commentator whose editor was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. And much, much more." />

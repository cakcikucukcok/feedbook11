  <title>The Darkness of Prejudice - Azubuike Isiguzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The darkness of prejudice paints a near-perfect picture of the events that led to the first murder on earth in the most communicative and intriguing of manners. Originally called the agrapha of Cain and Abelagrapha, a Greek word meaning unwritten and unspoken things. 
By divine revelation, the author sheds great insight into the life and times of the two brothers back in their garden and, by a parallel comparison, shows how today people can live a happy and fulfilled life free of hurts and the excess weight of past and present resentments if they can find and connect with the strongest resource in the heart of man, inner peace, which comes alive by acknowledging certain undeniable truths about the human nature, which constantly needs to be on the fore if Gods ordained quality of life for men is to be achieved. 
The author compared scripture with scripture, scripture with nature, and vice versa, to bring a captivating thought-provoking balance to learning that will stir up the minds of the reader into productive action irrespective of personal affiliations and allegiances, as the book calls up the burning emptiness that tells you exactly what you need to do. 
If a tranquil mind free from botheration, moral conflicts, and agitating passions is what you seek, a place where actions and inactions rather than being the ultimate defining moments of ones life becomes another learning curve and a springboard into becoming a better person, then this is a must read for you." />

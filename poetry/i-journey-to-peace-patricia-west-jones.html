  <title>I Journey to Peace - Patricia West-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Local poet and singer Patricia West-Jones has been composing poetry since 1998.  Originally from New York, but born in Atlantic City, West-Jones father died when she was seven years old. The years following were troubled times.  She remembers sitting for hours sucking her fingers, something she continued to do for many years, seeking comfort. Now she finds peace and comfort writing poetry and short stories.
A wife and mother of two daughters and a son, Pat works for the Pleasantville School District in the Counseling Department. West Jones says that for her life is like the following:
One day she was working out on a track that went round and old house that sits on the bay.  She is walking bent over because the breeze off the water had picked up and was pressing her back; it was very difficult to go forward.  When she rounded the bend, the wind was  now at her back pushing her forward.  So for Pat, life at times presses her back but  with prayer and determination she presses  her  way as her writing moves  her ever closer  to peace.
	Patricia West-Jones poems will appeal to a diverse audience: Women, mothers, and Christians, as well as those who have struggled to find themselves on their life journey" />

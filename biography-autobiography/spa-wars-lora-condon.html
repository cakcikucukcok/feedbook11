  <title>Spa Wars - Lora Condon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spa Wars was featured in the New York Times, Time Out New York and American Spa Magazine!
What really happens when the spa door closes, the shades shut, and the staff thinks no one is looking? In &lt;i&gt;Spa Wars: The Ugly Truth about the Beauty Industry,&lt;/i&gt; seasoned esthetician Lora Condon provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the beauty industry while sharing her personal experiences working in day spas, at cosmetic counters, and as a freelance makeup artist.
Lora Condon has been a licensed esthetician for over ten years. Through mouth-dropping, laugh-out-loud personal anecdotes, she reveals all the dirty secrets of the spa and cosmetic and beauty industries. As she uncovers common lies and myths propagated by cosmetic companies, advertisers, and magazines, Condon also addresses common questions and complaints about beauty issues, provides easy-to-apply tips and tricks such as how to keep skin looking young and fresh, and shares her favorite beauty and health items as well as the best therapists, treatments, and organizations.
&lt;i&gt;Spa Wars&lt;/i&gt; uncovers the ugly truths of a fascinating industry for anyone who has ever wondered what their bikini waxer is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; thinking while ripping out their hair." />

  <title>Eight Stories Up: An Adolescent Chooses Hope over Suicide - DeQuincy Lezine, David Brent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Suicide is the third leading cause of death for young Americans aged 15-24. As a teenager, DeQuincy Lezine nearly ended his own life-he believed it was the only way to end the emotional pain and misery caused by clinical depression. Instead, Lezine was able to receive expert psychiatric care, and went on to found the first campus-based chapter of the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA.
  Now a researcher at the University of Rochester Center for the Study and Prevention of Suicide, Lezine is particularly devoted to preventing adolescent suicide, and he brings the wealth of his personal and professional experience to bear in Eight Stories Up. He first describes his deteriorating state of mind in college, pinpointing some of the origins of the depression that would nearly claim his life.  He then goes on to use his experiences to offer wisdom and practical advice to other young people who may be considering suicide.  In straightforward, easy-to-understand language and along with the psychiatric expertise of David Brent, MD, Lezine discusses what is known about suicide in adolescents, how to seek psychiatric treatment, and how to get the most out of professional help.  He also surveys some of the therapists used to prevent suicide, how to talk to loved ones about suicidal thoughts, and how to stay healthy at home and at school.  The result is both a remarkable memoir and a useful guide that will help to ease the isolation and suffering caused by thoughts of suicide, assuring young people that, with commitment and hard work, they can overcome their troubles in a safe and healthy way.
  Part of the Adolescent Mental Health Initiative series of books written specifically for teens and young adults, Eight Stories Up offers hope to young people who are at risk of suicide, offering a lifeline of experienced support and guidance that could save their lives." />

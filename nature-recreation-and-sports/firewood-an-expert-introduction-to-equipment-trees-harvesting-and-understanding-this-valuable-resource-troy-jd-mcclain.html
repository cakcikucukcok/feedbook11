  <title>Firewood: An Expert Introduction to Equipment, Trees, Harvesting and Understanding This Valuable Resource - Troy Jd McClain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever contemplated venturing out into the world with the intent of harvesting a tree or two for firewood?  Do you know what to do and how to do it?  Are you familiar with trees, the differences between the trees that make suitable firewood and those that do not?  Have you received instruction on how to properly fell a tree?  Including those that do not stand straight up?  What about how to protect yourself from the dangers of felling a tree and the hazards it poses once it&amp;#39;s on the ground?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is written by a professional chainsaw operator with over twenty years of experience sizing up, felling, limbing, bucking, and processing firewood.  In these pages you will be introduced to more than just how to cut down a tree; but with the purpose of producing firewood you should be interested in topics of how to estimate harvest weight and BTU (British Thermal Unit) output. In addition you will learn about the proper personal protection equipment you require, what chainsaw sizes are best suitable for the job, how to properly measure your firewood, and how to best split and stack your harvest.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first of a series of three books this volume will equip you with the knowledge of the basics of firewood production." />

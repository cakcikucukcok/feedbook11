  <title>The Shoelace Fairy - Judy Allston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After several weeks of teaching Kindergarten in 2011, I realized that I spent a lot of time tying shoelaces.  And, as always, most shoes seem to come untied just when the class was on it&#39;s way out of the classroom.   One day after tying the same child&#39;s shoes for the 2nd time in less than 20 minutes, I blurted out &quot;It must be the Shoelace Fairy that is untying your shoes.&quot; The idea of a Shoelace Fairy actually in our classroom got the children excited, as finally, there was a good reason they always had untied shoes.  I kept hearing the children complain that she was to blame for their shoelace problems. Later that night, I started thinking about the Shoelace Fairy and what she does to make kids and teachers crazy. A few weeks later, the book concept was completed and the adventures of the Shoelace Fairy has begun." />

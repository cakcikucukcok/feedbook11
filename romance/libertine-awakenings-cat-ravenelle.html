  <title>Libertine Awakenings - Cat Ravenelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    Alexis Downing is beautiful, smart, and focused on her masters thesis. She seems to have it all, but the secrets of her past have left her broken and
    devoid of feeling. As a result, she regards men and sex as necessary inconveniences until she meets Justin Simmons, a handsome scientist from Chicago. He
    invites her to engage in a one-night stand. No strings. She just needs to do what he says and relinquish her control.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Intrigued, Alexis decides to take a risk.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Through Justins guidance, she experiments with bondage and submission. Its her first time and the liaison leaves her wanting more. An agreement is made
    and Justin takes her on a journey of pleasure and pain that leaves her breathless, yet stronger than ever before. In each lesson, she learns about trust
    and humility. In each session, her emotional self emerges a bit more. They explore every aspect of her evolving sexuality. As she awakens to pleasure shes
    never experienced, her boundaries expand. She begins to understand that submission brings power. Power that she will cling to as the secrets of her past
    are revealed.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Libertine Awakenings is the psychosexual odyssey of Alexis Downing. Filled with smoldering, graphic sex, mystery, and romance, Libertine Awakenings is
    bound to please and enticeeven without a safe word.

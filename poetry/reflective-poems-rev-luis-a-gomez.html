  <title>Reflective Poems - Rev. Luis A. Gomez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I am in a hospital or hurting in silence, I want Chaplain Luis Gomez to comfort me and lead me deeper into truth and trusting in the Living God. His poems are written out of his own experiences. (Like David the Psalmist). He encourages us to grasp the hand of the Savior. Luis has helped thousands of people, people in destitute, people enslaved, people of various disabilities, people abandoned, people dying and people who feels hopeless. Luiss poems are real, his works bring us to light and life in our Lord.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. J. Scott Horrell&lt;br&gt;
Professor of Theological Studies&lt;br&gt;
Dallas Theological Seminary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For those days when we need comfort through awe inspiring poems and reflections that covers every facet of human emotions, his eloquent and sensitivity in his style of writing are to be cherished by every household. He truly has a beautiful gift in writing poems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

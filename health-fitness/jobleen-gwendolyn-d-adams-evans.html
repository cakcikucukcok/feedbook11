  <title>Jobleen - Gwendolyn D. Adams-Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jobleen suffered low  self esteem.  She was the victim of physical abuse, molestation and rape.  Her mental stability was unbalanced, which made her turn away from living a decent life.  She turned to drugs and prostitution, left her baby with her mother so that she could roam the streets for as many days and nights as she chose to do. Her body resembled that of a skeleton. Matted hair, unclean and high she had a wake- up call and grew tired of her going nowhere lifestyle.  One day she picked up her Bible and began to read the book of Job.  She never knew why she was led to read it, she simply opened her Bible and it revealed Job. As she read she sought help and managed to walk from her past and into the future. She went cold turkey on her own and learned how to heal the moment she reached out to God.  Her past life was painful. As a child she was abused and raped.  As a young mother, her life was not good. Living in a negative situation, she was the blame for she knew she had to change. She was not focused on productivity, only on getting high and slumming around the street. She dared death to claim her, yet she made every possible attempt to increase her dare.   Death became her partner, waiting on the moment she tripped up to claim her. One time too many with the needle she used to fill her body with heroin or smoke an eight ball of cocaine, would be deaths celebration. She failed to realize that she had to change for the benefit of her daughter Chasity, her grandson Cameron and herself. Twenty three years later, she was a productive woman who worked in her home, making floral designs she sold to various businesses. Her income was enough to help her maintain her home and personal finances.  The only thing that was out of control was that she and her twenty-three year old daughter argued daily about the lack of her daughters inability to be a mother to her ten year old son, Cameron. Chasitys unstable lifestyle with her boyfriend Ricky, an ex-convict made matters worse. Rickys twenty-four- seven job, lined his pockets with all of the presidents every day from his black market porno and drug business. He photographed nude prostitutes in porn situations and sold them to an underground buyer, along with a hefty sale of drugs. He had it made with Chasity, so he thought until she realized that her mother was right about him all along.  She, as her mother sought help to turn her life around and become the mother and daughter God intended for her to be.  She judged her mother as being dysfunctional in her life as a child.  Chasitys son Cameron, made her realize, she was also a dysfunctional mother with different circumstances." />

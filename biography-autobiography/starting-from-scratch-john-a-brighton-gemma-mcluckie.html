  <title>Starting from Scratch - John A. Brighton, Gemma McLuckie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raised in a chaotic household during the Depression and World War II in a small Indiana town, Dr. John Brighton felt trapped from the first day of school. Because of undiagnosed hearing damage and ADHD, he was labeled as slow. It wasnt until he discovered engineering that he even considered going to college. Counselors predicted he would certainly fail. Instead, he proved the naysayers wrong and earned a mechanical engineering PhD from Purdue University. 
In Starting from Scratch, John Brighton, former provost at Penn State University, shares insights gained during almost fifty years at prestigious institutions such as Michigan State and Georgia Tech. His work as a teacher and administrator touched thousands of students, while his fluid mechanics research was vital to assisting damaged hearts. 
Parents whose children are in difficulty can take heart in how John Brighton overcame his own challenges. Professionals seeking to improve their skills will find sage advice on management.
Starting from Scratch weaves a fascinating story that traces the arc of a successful academic career, but shows that loss can come even in ivory towers." />

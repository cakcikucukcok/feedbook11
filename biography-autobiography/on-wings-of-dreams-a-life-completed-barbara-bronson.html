  <title>On Wings of Dreams,  a Life Completed - Barbara Bronson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On Wings of Dreams, while simultaneously a deeply personal memoir/biography of the writer and her husband, is also a sharing of the universal experience of loss and transformation.   The narrative is woven seamlessly into the psychological framework of Carl Jungs writings.
Jung wrote of another kind of time, not horizontal time - the time of clocks and calendars that rule our lives.  This vertical time is experienced through those shared motifs found in our collective human memory.    Carl Jung describes this as the collective unconscious, the intersection where we experience horizontal time and are connected to the Divine in vertical time. Through the un-folding of our dreams we are touched and transformed by this connection.   On Wings of Dreams takes the reader through this transformational journey, lighting the way we must all eventually follow.
Mrs. Mary Jane Leone, a first reader/editor wrote:  I have never experienced dream journals so completely shared and explained by a loving couple with 40 years of marriage.  Life and death journeys melded into one!  Combining Carl Jungs teachings, with your world wide experience through reading and living, plus your deeply shared religious beliefs is a book completed and ready to be published.  It is a treasure not to be lost." />

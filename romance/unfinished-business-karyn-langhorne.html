  <title>Unfinished Business - Karyn Langhorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Black activist Erica Johnson wears her causes on her sleeve&amp;#8212;literally. With her class of beloved fourth graders depending on her to represent their concerns, Erica&#39;s ready to confront golden-boy conservative senator Mark Newman. And she&#39;s willing to suffer through a night in jail and a battle of wits with a real-life war hero, if it will help get the children the money they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Newman&#39;s a worthy adversary. But there&#39;s a more human side to the ambitious politician with the dreamy blue eyes&amp;#8212;from the physical pain of his war wound, to his grief over his wife&#39;s death. Though they disagree on every hot-button issue, Erica and Mark can&#39;t resist their attraction or ignore the unfinished business between them&amp;#8212;much to the delight of those trying to use this new relationship against the senator. And when Erica starts receiving some particularly vicious hate mail she has to decide if this handsome dream from the right/&lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; side of the political fence is worth risking her heart for . . . and maybe her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="Alpine Woods Shifter, #1 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nothing will stop a wolf once he&#39;s found his mate.  .  .not even her own doubts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After her skulk abandoned her four years ago, Samantha knew she would never truly be wanted. When she accidentally stumbles into a wolf town and is asked by their premier to stay, she believes it&#39;s the novelty of an arctic fox motivating him. She knows she&#39;ll be on her own again once he tires of her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jason finds himself pulled to Samantha from the moment she faints in his arms. His wolf is calling to him, telling him he&#39;s found their mate and the heat he feels for Samantha is impossible to resist. But his little fox is loaded down with emotional baggage and doesn&#39;t believe she&#39;s worthy of love. Can he overcome her fears? Or will pack jealousies and the local foxes convince her she doesn&#39;t belong with him before he has a chance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;28,000 Words" />

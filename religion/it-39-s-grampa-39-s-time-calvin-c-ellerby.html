  <title>It&#39;s Grampa&#39;s Time - Calvin C Ellerby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Grampa&amp;#39;s Time&amp;quot; is a blueprint and manual on how the family patriarch can impart the blessing of God into the lives of those he has had committed into his care. This book articulates and presents the &amp;quot;5 Step Blueprint&amp;quot; for such an impartation, and challenges men everywhere to respond to God&amp;#39;s commission to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whispers from God often appear to fall on deaf ears. Fortunately, there are leaders like Cal, who are driven to hear those whispers from God and avail themselves as a conduit through which God can flow His love and purposes. It&amp;#39;s Grampa&amp;#39;s Time is the manifestation of one of those whispers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This specific whisper is both profound and timely. As you read, you will find yourself drawn into a story masterfully woven together with a focus on biblical history, order, structure, and consistency. The challenge you will ultimately find yourself forced to either embrace or reject, will eventually become a fact of history. While you are free to decide your response, you will not defy the inevitable outcome of that response. Leadership is not for the casually interested. It will always extract more than we intended to invest. Our role as leaders was not our decision. Being a patriarch is not a chosen position, but rather, one determined by God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

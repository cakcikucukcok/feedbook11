  <title>The Shadow-Line - Joseph Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Joseph Conrad&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;&amp;#39;The Shadow Line&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, written in 1915, the author explores the passage to manhood.&lt;br /&gt;
The story begins with thoughts of youth and its lack of introspection and reflection. The narrator speaks of &amp;#39;&amp;#39;rash moments&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, such as when one suddenly marries. He says there is a &amp;#39;&amp;#39;shadow line&amp;#39;&amp;#39; that must be crossed from youth to adulthood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This is indeed a work full of &amp;quot;sudden passions,&amp;quot; in which Conrad is able to show how the full intensity of existence can be experienced by the man who, in the words of the older Captain Giles, is prepared to &amp;quot;stand up to his bad luck, to his mistakes, to his conscience.&amp;quot; A subtle and penetrating analysis of the nature of manhood, &amp;quot;The Shadow-Line&amp;quot; investigates varieties of masculinity and desire in a subtext that counters the tale&amp;#39;s seemingly conventional surface.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Shadow-Line&amp;quot; is based upon events and experiences from twenty-seven years earlier to which Conrad returned obsessively in his fiction. A young sea captain&amp;#39;s first command brings with it a succession of crises: his sea is becalmed, the crew laid low by fever, and his deranged first mate is convinced that the ship is haunted by the malignant spirit of a previous captain.&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>Rupert&#39;s Land - Meredith Quartermain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the height of the Great Depression, two Prairie children struggle with poverty and uncertainty. Surrounded by religion, law, and her authoritarian father, Cora Wagoner daydreams about what it would be like to abandon society altogether and join one of the Indian tribes she&#39;s read so much about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saddened by struggles with Indian Agent restrictions, Hunter George wonders why his father doesn&#39;t want him to go to the residential school. As he too faces drastic change, he keeps himself sane with his grandmother&#39;s stories of Wîsahkecâhk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Cora and Hunter sojourn through a landscape of nuisance grounds and societal refuse, they come to realize that they exist in a land that is simultaneously moving beyond history and drowning in its excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Rupert&#39;s Land&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The background of despair is familiar from writers like Sinclair Ross, but the way Quartermain brings an age to life while staring unflinchingly at its attitudes and injustices through the eyes of children is reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;To Kill A Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt;. The same innocent intelligence that characterizes Scout in that novel informs Cora&#39;s and Hunter&#39;s acute observations, conveyed in a blend of pitch perfect dialogue and inner voices.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Margaret Thompson, &lt;i&gt;The Coastal Spectator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Quartermain&#39;s background in poetry is evident in the novel&#39;s lyricism.

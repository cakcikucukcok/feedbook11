  <title>The Armenian Genocide is Corraborated by the International Scholary, Legal and Human Rights Community - Nikolay Hovhannisyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For about 50 years the author has been studying different aspects of the Armenian Genocide, as well as fundamental problems of genocides in general, in different countries of Asia, America, Africa and Europe in XX-XXI centuries.&lt;br /&gt;
After the investigation and detailed analysis of many primary sources, official documents and other materials, he has revised the obsolete opinions and suggested a new conceptual-strategic approach to the evaluation of the Armenian Genocide, committed in 1915 in the Ottoman Empire by the ruling Young Turk Party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
On the base of it, he came to the conclusion that:&lt;br /&gt;
a/The Armenian Genocide is already an internationally recognized genocide, corroborated and recognized by the international scholarly, legal and human rights community;&lt;br /&gt;
b/The Ottoman Empire was not merely the first state that committed the first genocide of XX century-the Armenian Genocide, but also the first state that recognized the crime in 1919 by the Ottoman court-martial Verdict;&lt;br /&gt;
c/Turkey is the founder of the genocide-denial industry;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
d/Now a new phase has begun: transition from the recognition of the Armenian Genocide to the liquidation of the heavy cosenquences of the Armenian Genocide, committed in 1915 in the Ottoman Empire." />

  <title>Why Do I  Think I Need You! - Cynthia Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book was composed in respect toward many sources of women who believe that men are the main spectrum in their lives. The book will identify a womans need and perceived needs from a man. There are many women globally that have their own perspective and ideology on how to satisfy a man. Therefore, how do women overcome battles in finding the right man? Perhaps it is just a psychological process for women to believe that they can gain ownership through their flesh and desires. When one evaluate it content is their every ownership involved, even in midst of marriage or commitment. The book displays parts that women play in a relationship; it shows values in having a relationship. In addition, it will identify peoples views, realities, concepts, and experiences toward the nature of having a relationship. Many have forgotten the significant dynamics in having a healthy relationship. Therefore, it is not a male-bashing book; it is for one to address problems, get insight and knowledge on issues so a person can correct them. In order to do so, men and women had to be mentioned within the book because two people are needed to make a relationship. 
In addition, the book was diplomatic to give inspiration and examples to the young and the old in gaining healthy relationships. Many of the stories are funny, sad, exciting, exotic, damn sexy, and explicit from a womans point of view. The purpose in that is, we live in a real world and pretend not to see things for what they really are, leaving room for disappointment. The book was based on interviews, research, life experiences, and a bit of fiction. 
My hopes are for you to enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed writing it again! I like to give thanks to many who believe in my creativeness in Why Do I Think I Need You? 
Sincerely, 
Love you all!" />

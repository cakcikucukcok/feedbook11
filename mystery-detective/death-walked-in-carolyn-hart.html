  <title>Death Walked In - Carolyn Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Max Darling hasn&#39;t been interested in crime since his brush with a seductive young woman put him in danger of losing his freedom. He even refuses to talk to a woman who calls for help and says she is afraid. The caller leaves word she&#39;s hidden something in the antebellum house Max and his wife, Annie, are restoring. When Annie finds out, she hurries to the woman&#39;s home, only to discover she&#39;s been murdered. Evidence links the dead woman to a fortune in gold coins that has recently gone missing. Was this mysterious woman killed for a fortune in coins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dead woman&#39;s son is accused but Max believes in his innocence, and Max and Annie plunge wholeheartedly into the investigation. Are the coins hidden in Annie and Max&#39;s house? The intruder who shoots at Max seems to think so. And when Annie discovers the secret of their old house, death arrives at their door.&lt;/p&gt;" />

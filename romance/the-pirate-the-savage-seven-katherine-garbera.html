  <title>The Pirate: The Savage Seven - Katherine Garbera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They&#39;re the Savage Seven--a ragged group of mercenaries who trust no one, risk everything, and get the job done, no matter what it takes.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J.P. Lazarus is an ex-Navy Seal who&#39;s parlayed his technical expertise into a lucrative and dangerous career. Laz has never lost any sleep over his choices, but then again, he&#39;s never met anyone like Dr. Daphne Barrett. She saves lives; he takes them. He changes his persona with every mission; she&#39;s straight as an arrow. His latest assignment--setting a trap for Somalian pirates--was risky before, but with the doctor on board his tanker, it&#39;s a matter of life, death, and off-the-charts desire.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working in Africa for a summer seemed like a good way for Daphne to regroup after her divorce. But when her vessel is hijacked, Daphne&#39;s status as a senator&#39;s ex-wife makes her a perfect target for ransom. If there&#39;s one man equipped to protect her, it&#39;s Laz. But the more she learns about him, the more questions arise--about the secrets he&#39;s hiding, the chemistry that feels too good to fight, and a future that neither of them can take for granted.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Katherine Garbera rocks!&quot; --Cindy Gerard" />

  <title>God, the Same Yesterday Today and Forever - Steven B. Riddley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God The Same Yesterday Today and Forever 
From the beginning of time after the fall of Adam, man has not understood his purpose in life on Earth. The unknown mysteries of life have put man on a pursuit to find answers that are already before him. This is where not knowing his creator who has all the answers. It the enemy of our soul that has kept us from ever knowing the age old question? What is truth? The universal mysteries have put man on a pursuit of the infinity to his own short life span and dies never to find the answer. Have you the reader, ever looked at the wonders that are in this world and asked the question, where did it all get it origin? Is there some one out there greater than I? I have found that there are people born with no knowledge of a higher intelligence than them selves. We call them atheist. Well, this book is about to introduce you to the reality of there is a God and at some point in the time of your life here or in the hereafter you will meet him. The fear of the unknown has caused us all with out the knowledge of truth to create an inner world that exists in our thoughts that leads us to live a life of willing ignorance. This reality block in our minds creates a false sense of security that is based in the material things of this world that can not talk, speak or hear. These are the idols we in a western world that have become the cymbals of achievements that we value as a reason for living. Have you ever thought where these gifts to create these natural phenomenons came from? Well, for seven years the God I serve has given me the answers to many of these questions about man, the cosmos and planet Earth., all of which he created. I am sure that when you read this book, the obvious signs will convince you of these realities, we all have been a willing participants in the ignorance that have led up to our present state in the world. Mark 8:36 (KJV) 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" />

  <title>Blue Pyramids - Robert Priest, Dean Budnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From his first book, The Visible Man (&quot;as fine a first volume of poetry as one is ever likely to read&quot; - the Dalhousie Review), to his most recent, Resurrection In the Cartoon (&quot;passionate, humourous, worldly-wise, kick-ass poetry&quot; - The Vancouver Sun), Robert Priest&#39;s poetry has been the delight of critics and readers alike. Blue Pyramids: New and Selected Poems brings together the best of Robert Priest&#39;s six books of lyric poems, spells, psalms, aphorisms, koans, diatribes, and prose poems along with an exciting new group of poems and aphorisms. Also included is a selection of never-before-published song lyrics. Relentless in their assessment of contemporary culture, the mordant irony, brutal honesty, and remarkable sensitivity of priest&#39;s works create a poetic crucible in which the Canadian &quot;melting-pot&quot; is purified of its hypocrisies and reclaimed, ultimately, in the joy of language. Poetry full of flashes of insight. Imaginative in a strange way, he takes inordinate chances with logic, countering absurdity with absurdity, and expanding our sense of human emotional possibilities.  - The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature" />

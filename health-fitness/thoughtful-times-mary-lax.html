  <title>Thoughtful Times - Mary Lax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    Writing this book is my way of sharing what Ive learned in the course of my life on earthsome very unique life experiences and some most of us have in
    common. I believe its this information that ought to be shared more freely by all of us, to enable the creation of better ways than wars and prejudices to
    take care of personal and collective interests and responsibilities.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Its not possible to make life improvements unless we fully own what is and isnt working well. Its also not possible to obtain and provide needed help
    unless we share what assistance is lacking and available. As a favorite professor insisted at the start of every class, Our sickness is revealed in our
    secretswe must uncover and study what we keep so well hidden before its possible to cure it.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    There are two rules essential to assuring this sharing is productive and non-hurtful. Those key rules are truthfulness and kindness. The stories in this
    book represent what happens when these rules are well applied and when they arent, to encourage careful management of all interactions so that all
    participants are treated with due respect. There are chapters, as well, that encourage better understanding and use of human emotions and behavior
    generally.

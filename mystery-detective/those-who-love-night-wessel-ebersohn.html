  <title>Those Who Love Night - Wessel Ebersohn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Abigail Bukula, a young lawyer in the South African Justice Department, learns that the secret son of her aunt, who died in a massacre years ago, has been arrested by the Zimbabwean government, she races to his aid. She&#39;s as determined as ever but perhaps a bit naive as well. Accused of being a part of the so-called Harare Seven, her cousin is being held as a political prisoner in the country&#39;s most brutal prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only an eager young lawyer as an ally and a director of the country&#39;s intelligence agency either helping her or setting her up, Bukula will not leave without winning her cousin&#39;s freedom and learning what really happened to her aunt so many years ago. By cunning, by bribery, by sheer audacity--and with the help of her friend prison psychologist Yudel Gordon--Abigail is determined to prevail in Those Who Love Night, Wessel Ebersohn&#39;s explosive follow-up to his critically acclaimed series debut.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>No Time Like the Present - Nadine Gordimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sharply observed new novel about post-apartheid South Africa from the Nobel Prize winner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadine Gordimer is one of our most telling contemporary writers. With each new work, she attacks--with a clear-eyed fierceness, a lack of sentimentality, and a deep understanding of the darkest depths of the human soul--her eternal themes: the inextricable link between personal and communal history; the inescapable moral ambiguities of daily life; the political and racial tensions that persist in her homeland, South Africa. And in each new work is fresh evidence of her literary genius: in the sharpness of her psychological insights, the stark beauty of her language, the complexity of her characters, and the difficult choices with which they are faced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;No Time Like the Present&lt;/i&gt;, Gordimer trains her keen eye on Steve and Jabulile, an interracial couple living in a newly, tentatively, free South Africa. They have a daughter, Sindiswa; they move to the suburbs; Steve becomes a lecturer at a university; Jabulile trains to become a lawyer; there is another child, a boy this time. There is nothing so extraordinary about their lives, and yet, in telling their story and the stories of their friends and families, Gordimer manages to capture the tortured, fragmented essence of a nation struggling to define itself post-apartheid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject is contemporary, but Gordimer&#39;s treatment is, as ever, timeless. In &lt;i&gt;No Time Like the Present&lt;/i&gt;, she shows herself once again a master novelist, at the height of her prodigious powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Black Blade Blues - J. A. Pitts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah Beauhall has more on her plate than most twenty-somethings: day job as a blacksmith, night job as a props manager for low-budget movies, and her free time is spent fighting in a medieval re-enactment group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead actor breaks Sarah&#39;s favorite one-of-a-kind sword, and to avoid reshooting scenes, Sarah agrees to repair the blade. One of the extras, who claims to be a dwarf, offers to help. And that&#39;s when things start to get weird. Could the sword really be magic, as the &quot;dwarf&quot; claims? Are dragons really living among us as shapeshifters?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as if things weren&#39;t surreal enough, Sarah&#39;s girlfriend Katie breaks out the dreaded phrase... &quot;I love you.&quot;  As her life begins to fall apart, first her relationship with Katie, then her job at the movie studio, and finally her blacksmithing career, Sarah hits rock bottom. It is at this moment, when she has lost everything she has prized, that one of the dragons makes their move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly what was unthinkable becomes all too real...and Sarah will have to decide if she can reject what is safe and become the heroine who is needed to save her world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

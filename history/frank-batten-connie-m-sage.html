  <title>Frank Batten - Connie M. Sage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Batten Sr. (1927–2009) created the Weather Channel in 1982, despite
    mocking by colleagues in the media that around-the-clock weather broadcasts would be as exciting
    as watching paint dry. The network, and later its companion website, Weather.com, became the
    largest private weather company in the world and an American cultural
    icon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet few have heard of Batten, a media pioneer whose Virginia newspaper
    was the only major daily to back school integration. At a time when American corporate greed was
    making headlines, without fanfare and limelight Batten built a media empire centered on honesty,
    integrity, and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting out in his uncle’s newspaper business in
    Norfolk, Virginia, as a reporter and advertising salesman, he assumed leadership of the
    &lt;i&gt;Virginian-Pilot&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ledger-Star&lt;/i&gt; at the age of twenty-seven
    and grew Landmark Communications into a media powerhouse. He championed racial equality, a
    position not often taken in Virginia during the 1950s. His flagship newspaper, the
    &lt;i&gt;Pilot,&lt;/i&gt; was the only daily paper in Virginia to back court-ordered school
    desegregation. He created two billion-dollar businesses and gave away more than $400 million
    to charity, nearly all of it to education. As chairman of the Associated Press from 1982 to
    1987, he helped guide the news agency back on a sound financial footing.&lt;p&gt; Batten also
    faced a tremendous personal challenge that would have sidelined many: he lost his vocal cords to
    cancer two years before starting the Weather Channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the untold story
    of a man whose name few recognize, yet who helped change the face of the media in the twentieth
    century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

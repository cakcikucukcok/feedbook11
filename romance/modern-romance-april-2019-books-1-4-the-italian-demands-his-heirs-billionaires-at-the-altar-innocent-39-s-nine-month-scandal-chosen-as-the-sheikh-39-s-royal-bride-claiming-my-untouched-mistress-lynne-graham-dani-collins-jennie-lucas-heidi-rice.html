        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The latest red-hot romances from Mills &amp; Boon Modern!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Italian Demands His Heirs&lt;/em&gt; by Lynne Graham&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To counter a media scandal, billionaire Raffaele di Mancini must marry fiery Vivi Mardas. But when she rejects his convenient proposal, he’s stunned. How can she deny their searing chemistry? Determined to convince Vivi to be his temporary bride, Raffaele’s not above using one night of seduction! But when Vivi discovers she’s carrying his twins, Rafaelle demands she meet him down the aisle—for real!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innocent’s Nine-Month Scandal&lt;/em&gt; by Dani Collins&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Control is everything to billionaire Viktor Rohan. Then Rozalia Toth appears on his mansion’s doorstep, looking for a family heirloom, and throws his world into chaos! Her sweetness intrigues him beyond measure…and as their inescapable chemistry explodes, Viktor realises Rozi’s innocence isn’t an act! But their passion has consequences, and Viktor refuses to let scandal ruin his family again. Their baby will be legitimate! And Rozi? She will be his…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chosen as the Sheikh’s Royal Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Jennie Lucas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amongst the many beautiful, accomplished candidates hoping to be chosen as Sheikh Omar’s wife, shop assistant Beth can’t believe this powerful desert king would even notice her. Yet Omar does select her—and his heated gaze sets her alight, making her innocent body crave caresses she’s only dreamed about! She’s instantly thrown into his world of unimagined luxury, but can this shy Cinderella ever be a queen…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claiming My Untouched Mistress &lt;/em&gt;by Heidi Rice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Walking into my casino, Edie Spencer seemed like a spoilt heiress—until she agreed to clear her family’s debts by posing as my temporary mistress. My plan? To use her to expose my business rivals. Yet discovering Edie’s innocence has led to greater temptation than I could have imagined. Our chemistry is spectacular—now I’ll claim Edie for so much more than pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;

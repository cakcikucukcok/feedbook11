  <title>The Darkest Link - Scarlett Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The breathtaking finale to Scarlett Cole&#39;s smoldering tattoo series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her car breaks down off the side of a lonely highway far from her sunny Miami home, tattoo artist Lia never expected her very own white knight to ride up on the back of a barely street-legal motorcycle...and she never expected to fall for her dark savior. After a string of failed relationships and a bruised heart Lia is not looking for forever, and the hot mechanic, with his sexy scruff and shaggy hair, is simply impossible to resist. He&#39;s the perfect candidate for a mind-blowingly-perfect, no-strings-attached one-night stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid left his life in Chicago far behind him and hasn&#39;t been back, but he&#39;s never been able to escape the guilt he feels about his own painful role in inviting a monster into his baby sister&#39;s life. A monster who almost destroyed her. Being with Lia is an unexpected gift, one he doesn&#39;t feel he deserves.  As unique and beautiful as the designs she inks, theirtheir one night together has him wanting more than he should. When he surprises her at her tattoo studio, Second Circle Tattoos, in Miami, he&#39;s in for a shock--and a fist to the face--when his past and present collide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With secrets coming to the surface, Reid and Lia are thrown into a world of betray and lies that threatens to pull them under, and the last link to his former life may be the darkest of them all.&lt;/p&gt;" />

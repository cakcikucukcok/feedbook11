  <title>Theofatalism™ - Lewis Tagliaferre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How much truth can you handle? What if the traditional things you were taught in church, synagogue, mosque, or temple are no longer relevant to your lifewhat if religion itself were not actually based on reality? Through the writings of his prophets and disciples in every major religion, the God of Moses has proven that he does whatever he wants with whoever he wants whenever he wants. 
But we do not have to accept this truththere is another way, a universal spiritual path to serenity and contentment for all people. In &lt;i&gt;Theofatalism: Personal Reformation for Troubled Souls,&lt;/i&gt; author Lewis Tagliaferre reveals the totality of Theofatalism, the truth-based belief system he established through extensive study and revelatory experiences in Sedona, Arizona, following the untimely death of his wife and the subsequent collapse of his faith in traditional Christian mores.
Theofatalism provided Tagliaferre with a new belief system that enabled him to survive and even grow from great tragedy. Tagliaferres indispensible collection of essays blends his personal experiences with the wisdom and knowledge of historians, scientists, gurus, and sages of diverse cultures, philosophies, and beliefs. The principles around which he reformed his perception of self and the world can never be created; they can only be discovered, understood, and shared." />

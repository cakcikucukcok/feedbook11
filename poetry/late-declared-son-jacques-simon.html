  <title>Late Declared Son - Jacques Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jain came to life in a huge controversy. Few months after his birth, he was put under the guardianship of his grandmother, who had taken away his premature mothers right to raise him. His young mother, at the behest of her parents, was relocated to a far location unbeknown to her son. Jain was kept in ignorance of his biological father, who had been rejected by his grandma for his low social rung. Happily, the young mothers situation will turn out well for her in her relocation! Her high education gains her an enviable position in administration. She is also able to win the admiration and respect of a rich suitor, who shortly marries her. Her husband is unaware of her sons existence. In the meantime, Jains grandmother dies and leaves this ten-year-old grandson desperate, dejected, fatherless, lonely, and miserable. However, Jain becomes one of the happiest children in the planet! How come?
Late Declared Son is a poetic work in which Jacques Simon sympathizes with the suffering children in the world, especially with those who are fatherless or neglected. This poetic work gives a glimmer of hope to single mothers who are going through challenging obstacles of todays family life!" />

  <title>All Shall Be Well - Lillian Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Any book that weaves together allusions to both Julian of Norwich and Biddy Early is worth checking out! Add in a dash of mystery, Celtic romance, and wry Irish humor, and the result is this engaging novel from Lillian Lewis, &lt;i&gt;All Shall Be Well&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl McColman, author of &lt;i&gt;The Big Book of Christian Mysticism&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;366 Celt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Kenny is many things, but she is definitely not a psychic. As she flies across the ocean to Ireland to bury her eccentric Aunt Mary, she has no idea that her last link to the old world is about to lead her straight into an intriguing Irish murder mystery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, as Morgans plane settles into its cruising altitude, she is overcome with a feeling that her Aunt Mary is attempting to contact her with an important message. After Morgan deplanes, she receives a telegram that informs her that her aunt has already been buried. Perplexed by the strange unfolding of events, Morgan silently wonders who has taken care of the final details, since she is the last remaining relative in the family. As she begins a fruitless search to find her aunts burial site and the familys ancestral home, Morgan is flooded with memories and voices of the dead who tell her she needs to mine old ways in order to claim her inheritance. Morgan must break the cipher, but not without the help of a teenager, a fourteenth-century English saint, and a handsome archeologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling tale rich with history and culture, an American woman embarks on an Irish adventure in which she will learn more about her ancestors and herself than she ever could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Arcade and the Triple T Token - Rashad Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Arcade and the Triple T Token&lt;/em&gt;, eleven-year-old Arcade Livingston has a problem. Several, actually. The Tolley twins, a.k.a. neighborhood bullies, are making Arcade&amp;rsquo;s move to a new city even harder than it needs to be. They expect&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to do&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;research papers and interactive displays for the sixth-grade career expo&amp;rsquo;s theme: &amp;ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&amp;rdquo; Besides doing their work, Arcade doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know his own answer to that question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at the library&amp;mdash;Arcade&amp;rsquo;s favorite place to chill&amp;mdash;a mysterious old woman gives him a golden arcade token that grants him a unique gift. A gift that allows him to time travel between different places including his own future. From sitting in the dugout with Babe Ruth, to hanging on to the back of a bucking bull, to performing life-saving surgery on a dog, Arcade has no shortage of adventure! Together with his older sister, Zoe, Arcade explores life&amp;rsquo;s biggest thrills and challenges, and the two also have a big mystery to solve. Who is the rightful owner of the incredible Triple T Token that leads to such astounding adventures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arcade&amp;rsquo;s circle of friends begins to widen as the Triple T Token hangs from his neck. Pulsing. Beckoning another adventure. The question for Arcade, Zoe, and their new friends is no longer, &amp;ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s, &amp;ldquo;Where will we go next?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read as part of the series or as a stand-alone novel!

When Arcade inserts the token into the slot, doors of opportunity open. And when he steps through them, thrilling, amusing, and sometimes scary adventures await. Arcade believes that the token was meant for him to learn about life so he can help others along the way.

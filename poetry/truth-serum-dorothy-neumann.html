  <title>Truth Serum - Dorothy Neumann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="a personal and sensitive study of passion and its exquisite colorsa journey through its many curves 
Dorothy Neumanns poems bring us into a world of broken saints and living gods, disenchanted dreamers and strayed revelers. They convey the sound of a lovers eyes and the sense of importance in what we do for our friends, colleagues, aging pets, and dying parents. Above all they bear witness to intense feeling, stunning discoveries about ones self and others, and the connectedness of private and public. You can feel the author weighing each poem in the palm of her hand and sending it to us with radiant generosity. 
William J. Kennedy, Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, Cornell University 
TRUTH SERUM is a complex, intimate, and haunting collection of poems that explores layers of human experience with warmth infused with deeply affecting insight. It is a colorful tapestry woven together from the strands of a rich life, a personal lifetime work of enormous power, passion, and wisdom. The reader is swept along on a bittersweet tide of honest and keen observation that reflects an introspective intensity of both the deeply personal and the universal with an absorbing integrity. The doubt, longing, and darkness of the human soul searching for light with startling imagery lingers and crackles in the air a search for lifes meaning and it is enough a superb accomplishment!

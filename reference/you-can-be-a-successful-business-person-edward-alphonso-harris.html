&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;I am very much aware of the volumes of books that have been written on the subject of Small Business Development and Management. However, I made the conscious decision to take a different approach and share my personal experiences, highlighting the many obstacles I encountered along the way in my more that 50 years of active involvement in the private sector in the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Caribbean&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;The path to achieving success in business begins with a mindset based upon information and education about the implications of business and a passion to succeed. In this age of information technology, there is no lack of information on how to develop a business and take it through its stages to being a successful business is well documented.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;My objective in this book is to present to my readers a holistic approach to developing and maintaining a successful business.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;I wish to address specifically the operations of the MICRO, SMALL and MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSMEs) within the private sector which accounts for as much as eighty five (85) percent of the workforce in some countries. The private sector is referred to as the engine of growth but the MSMEs are the engine of Employment. Many governments fail to give the level of support to this vitally important segment of the economy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;I invite you to journey with me as we navigate a path towards understanding the peculiarities, intricacies and technicalities of the operations of MSMEs in general but the &lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Caribbean&lt;/st1:place&gt; in particular. In spite cultures may differ, Business speaks an international language whether you are in an under developed, less developed or developed country.&lt;/P&gt;

  <title>The Elephant Gospel - Deborah Ann Saint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Gospel is more powerful, more redeeming, and greater than we live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been deeper in sin than most, like Paul, the woman at the well, and Peter after his denial. I have missed God, lived as an outcast sinner, and denied Gods presence and power in my life. Yet God has shown me His New Covenant of hope, the secret of hope I live by and love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you love has an ugly, seemingly unforgivable past like mine, you too can know by evidence from the Bible that you can be forgiven. You can learn to live forgiven, with a clear conscience. The relief from all guilt and shame is a pivotal gift of the Gospel that we get the privilege of offering in turn to others! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you or someone you care about down-trodden? Forgotten? Guilt-ridden? This book is for you. If youve had an abortion; if youre gender questioning; if youve been abused or addicted, its for you. It is for those society has given up on; its for the worst of us and the best of us. Its for those who think they are good enough and not sinners. All people everywhere can turn,look at Christs love, receive His forgiveness and know His salvation. He forgives murderHis grace changes everything! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniquely conveying truths through a series of four elephant parables, this book seeks to reveal the magnitude of what is at stake when we live true to the real Gospel, and what happens when we understand and herald the Gospel in the power Christ entrusted to us. May we use it for His glory, to advance His kingdom; for He came to save, not condemn.&lt;/p&gt;" />

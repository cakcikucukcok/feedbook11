  <title>Best Knowing Joy - Lou Potempa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BEST KNOWING JOY has been specifically written to significantly impact peoples lives. The book describes a process initiated by a free will choice and continuing through the experience of trust, empowerment, purpose and realization of successful achievement.  
The five stages in the process arise in a context of legacies extending from the fundamental aspects of creation of the Universe; namely, TRUTH, LIGHT and TIME. Initially, a base is established for the increased empowerment of individual consciousness and being. Thereafter, recognition of the human experience as the heir to Universal legacies gives rise to insights leading to cascading empowerment. 
Major insights and experiences serving as the foundation for the process stages include the control of TIME, disowning of negativity and distractions, understanding and acceptance of the Universal legacies, emergence of elevated awareness and understanding,  certitude of the envisioning of desired Will, pursuit of unbounded potential and manifestation and joy of truth.
The focus of being and consciousness to be used in the practice and application of the stages is detailed in a series of protocols and the use of unique descriptive symbols. A comprehensive template illustrating the practice and the successful application of the process in a major medical/surgical situation are described. 
The BEST KNOWING JOY process empowers beyond TRUST to TRUTH to life changing experiences, successful accomplishment and joy." />

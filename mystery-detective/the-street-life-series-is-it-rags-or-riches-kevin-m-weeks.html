  <title>The Street Life Series: Is It Rags or Riches? - Kevin M. Weeks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;When you read the Washington D.C. tabloids, you might surmise that Teco Jackson was slain by a delusional killer, The Paradox.  However, Federal Agents are not convinced.   A crime spree in Atlanta, Georgia is strikingly similar to that of the Washington, D.C. G-String murders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Atlanta Detective Paul Yeomans tries to keep the south&#39;s &quot;&quot;Phoenix City&quot;&quot; safe but is forced to seek help from Washington, D.C.&#39;s quick-witted and statuesque Detective Hanae Troop. Never realizing, until it&#39;s too late, the multi-jurisdiction operation is eventually forced into a propitious government mission with international appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Atlanta resident Gail Indigo Que (GQ), a former Strictly Business (SB) drug crew member, attempts to achieve legitimate riches by virtue of rags with her signature clothing line.  However, The Paradox feels double-crossed and elevates his deadly game to a new level by trying to sabotage GQ&#39;s fashion career and draw her back into the streets.  All in the name of lady justice, The Paradox has spread his vigilantly game across the entire metro-Atlanta area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Several weeks after investigating the case, the multi-jurisdiction law enforcement team solicits the assistance of an unlikely bodyguard to take GQ into protective custody.  Regardless, GQ is determined to succeed in fashion despite the odds.  Leaving the street life, is it rags or riches?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book Review:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Library Journal - The Word on Street Lit (November 19, 2009)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Paradox, a psychotic killer who leaves G-strings on his victims bodies, returns in the latest in Weekss self-published, award-winning Street Life series (after Is It Suicide or Murder? and Is It Passion or Revenge?). The murderer has moved from DC to Atlanta and is executing members of the Pennsylvanian SB (Strictly Business) crew. He sets his sights on GQ (Gail Que), who is living the rags or riches challenge to make it big in the fashion industry. Hot on The Paradoxs trail is Hanae Troop, a DC cop determined to bring him down. Troops lover, Teco Jackson, is a former member of SB and will fight to the death for her man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verdict: Weekss combination of mystery and police procedural will draw in readers as he shows the cops point of view. The long list of characters and plot tangents may be confusing, but bloody executions and a wild, climatic shoot-out will hold interest. Think of CBSs 48 Hours Mystery set to a street lit riff. [At the African American Pavilion at BookExpo 2009, Weekss books won the Urban Series of the Year Award.Ed.]

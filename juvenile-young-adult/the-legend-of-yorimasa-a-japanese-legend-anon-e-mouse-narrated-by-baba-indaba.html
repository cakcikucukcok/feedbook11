  <title>THE LEGEND OF YORIMASA - A Japanese Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 415&lt;br /&gt;
In this 415th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Japanese Legend, &amp;quot;THE LEGEND OF YORIMASA&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago, the Japanese Emperor became seriously ill. He was unable to sleep at night owing to a most horrible and unaccountable noise he heard from the roof of the palace. A number of his courtiers decided to lie in wait for this strange nocturnal visitor. As soon as the sun set they noticed that a dark cloud crept from the eastern horizon, and alighted on the roof of the palace. They heard extraordinary scratching sounds, as if what had at first appeared to be a cloud had suddenly changed into a beast with gigantic and powerful claws.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Night after night this terrible visitor came, and night after night the Emperor grew worse. He at last became so ill that it was decided that Yorimasa was the one knight in the kingdom valiant enough to relieve his Majesty of these terrible hauntings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well, as you would expect in these circumstances, &amp;nbsp;many things happened. To find the answers to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;

I was an ordinary girl who learnt some key things and now I live an extraordinary life and I share them with you in this book. This is for every woman who has experienced events (big or small) during her childhood that may have taken a toll on her esteem. We all need a boost, we have all had our confidence knocked at some stage in our life but we can change that as of today. &amp;nbsp;My story is here to show women that there is hope, you do matter and there is more to life than what you are experiencing. This book has been created for the women ready to upgrade their self-worth, transform their self-esteem and rebuild their confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is your birthright to shine bright, be free and feel entirely at home in your own skin but somewhere along the way your light got dimmer and your self-esteem started to hide away. This isn&amp;rsquo;t your fault and, in fact, it happens to almost everybody just by being alive in this modern, busy and crazy world; however, today you have the choice to turn your light back on. Born to Shine will be your complete companion in rediscovering your worth and living your life from a place of healthy self-esteem and inner confidence. As your typical girl-next-door Londoner, Cat Raincock brings a smile to your face with her heart-warming stories and down-to-earth advice.

She didn&amp;rsquo;t always have this life: the amazing family, beautiful home, fulfilling career&amp;hellip; in fact, just 5 years ago her life looked and felt very different. She was newly married and had two kids but she felt empty. Despite ticking the boxes that society told her would equal happiness, she felt lost, stuck, overwhelmed, underwhelmed and desperately wanted more from life. Was this it?! She made a commitment to herself to change her life and has dedicated the last few years to her. She should have known that the girl who grew up dreaming of being an actress wouldn&amp;rsquo;t settle for a mediocre life. She changed her story, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;" />

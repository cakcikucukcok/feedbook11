  <title>Misfortune to Millionaire - Marton Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    I think of myself, sitting around a pub table or around a campfire, as a story teller informing people of how to be successful enjoying life and helping
    others any way possible if I can.. That is the way I would like to be remembered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Of pure Irish descent, Marton Murphy can trace his family in North America back to 1836 and follow their progression from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
    North to Alaska and South to the Mexican border. As a boy growing up in Freetown, PEI, one of the prettiest and friendliest piece of ground in the world, I
    absorbed all I could about the familys earliest heritage including my fathers expertise in business and neighborliness and my mothers charitable good
    works as a nurse, class of 1921, who taught me how to live my life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I left home at the age of 18 and enjoyed a wide variety of jobs including farm chore boy, potato picker, cow hand, stooker, tobacco primer and fruit picker
    in the East. When arriving in the West I became a doodlebugger, oilfield roughneck, cat-skinner, construction worker, taxi driver while working my way up
    the corporate ladder before starting my own business in oil, land, cattle, engineering, contracting, environmental, manufacturing, distribution,
    transportation and travel while enjoying a life involved in church, community, charity, and back room politics while travelling the world for business and
    pleasure.

  <title>Innocent in His Diamonds (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Maya Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;As pure as ice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ana Duval knows that CEO Bastien Heidecker holds her family responsible for the destruction of his own. So when he’s forced to rescue her from a high-profile scandal, she doesn’t know what’s worse – his icy condemnation or her burning need for his kiss…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bastien witnessed his father’s ruin because of unchecked desire and despises such weakness – so it galls him to want Ana, the stunning face of his diamond business. Famed for his cool control, Bastien’s plan is to have the model, then discard her. But he’s shocked to discover that Ana is innocent in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; sense of the word…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Maya Blake&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innocent in His Diamonds &lt;em&gt;4* RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake’s fabricated crime is the perfect catalyst to bring this couple together. The Swiss-scapes are incredibly luxurious and the co-stars are spot on. But it is the battle the heroine fights — no spoilers here —that wins the day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ultimate Playboy &lt;em&gt;4.5* RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake’s romance between this implausible couple is mystifying and exciting. The chemistry between her vengeful, überplayboy hero and her innocent, mistrusting heroine is palpable. The ultra-lavishness fits, the lovemaking is fiery and the honest dialogue between the couple is tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Greek Can’t Resist &lt;em&gt;4.5* TOP PICK RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake’s embattled couple is the perfect yin and yang. It’s a sensual feast watching them fall in love in spite of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

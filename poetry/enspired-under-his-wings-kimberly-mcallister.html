  <title>Enspired Under His Wings - Kimberly McAllister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These God-inspired poems were given to me from God to heal the soul, and bring deliverance to the weary spirit. It wasn&#39;t until i surrendered my heart to God that i realized that He was using my life experiences as footprints for those who would go through the same things that i&#39;ve been through. He allowed me to go through trials and tribulations to be a blessing to others through poetic writing.This book was written to send healing to those who struggle with fear, insecurity, low-self esteem, depression, oppression, rejection,and negativity. It&#39;s my desire to know that through these beautiful collective poems, someone is being delivered, and healed from past and present wounds.   I Pray that you will enjoy them as much as i do.. God Bless....&lt;/p&gt;" />

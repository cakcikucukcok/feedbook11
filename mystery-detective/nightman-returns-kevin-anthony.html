As he shared a pocketful of lies about his disappearance, he soon realized it was the Miralisa crime syndicate that brought him into the open. He was in over his head and he knew it until Duke, a veteran of Vietnam and related assignments, was brought out of retirement to protect him.  The Miralisa were back in the Regent and so was their boss, Geppetto. As the Miralisa set the stage to frame Michael for murder to force his Uncle Paulo into their criminal enterprise, Michael&#39;s uncle is on the hunt to find the elusive Geppetto and put the Miralisa out of business.  As Michael stays one step ahead of the pursuing Miralisa, he finds that through it all Judy Richards has stayed with him." />

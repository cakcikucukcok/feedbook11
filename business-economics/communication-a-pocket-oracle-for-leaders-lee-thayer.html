  <title>Communication a Pocket Oracle for Leaders - Lee Thayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This splendid little pocket book will tell all of you leaders (oracle-style) what you need to know about communication to enhance your everyday performance and thus enable your success. In 53 succinct chapters, this pocket oracle sets forth the basic issues you absolutely need to understand from a highly pragmatic point of view. It is not derived from theories but from the authors 45+ years as a CEO coach and consultant.
What the author shares with you is what he has learned over all of those years, thousands of presentations, and being in the trenches with his client CEOs to partner with them in making thoroughly competent or high performance organizations. He worked with them through the implementation, where 95% of success comes from.
You will want to keep this oracle handy, and refer to it often. Some of the distilled wisdom contained here is counter-intuitive. Thats because it is based on the realities and not on platitudes about communication.
The key is how you talk to yourself. It is also about how you need to interpret the world in terms of your cause and your organizations mission. On a day-to-day basis, this book is about how to succeed personally if you are the leader. There is nothing more basic and more crucial for your success than the communication that occurs daily in your office, in the hallways, in your head, or in front of customers.
It will become your daily guidebook for understanding this most problematic of every leaders life. It may take you where you have never gone before. But where you need to go in your thinking and doing.&quot;" />

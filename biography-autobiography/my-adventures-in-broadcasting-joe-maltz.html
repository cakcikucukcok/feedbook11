  <title>My Adventures in Broadcasting - Joe Maltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joe Maltzs career as a broadcast engineer with the American Broadcasting Company spanned thirty-seven years and was followed by five years as a consultant to the television industry. In his memoir, &lt;i&gt;My Adventures in Broadcasting&lt;/i&gt;, he takes a look back at his experiences during televisions golden years from the usually invisible point of view of an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maltz participated in the technical preparation and execution of five Olympic Games, including the 1972 Munich Olympics, during which he covered the tragedy that unfolded there. For his engineering work on Olympic technical design, he won two Emmys. He also covered four political conventions and the first televised coverage of a Russian-American track meet in Moscow, which took place during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years memoirs about television broadcasting have been written and published by many notables in the industry. These memoirs recall events from an on-air perspective, ignoring the participation of the technical people that enabled these events to be successfully produced and executed. My Adventures in Broadcasting offers a unique, behind-the-scenes perspective on television coverage of major news and sporting events fills that void.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Winter Songs - Noelio Flores Pérez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winter songs are a selection of poems born in special circumstances during the winter of 2013. Being away from the homeland, family and friends produced and indescribable pain and an overwhelming sense of isolation, frustration and desperation, these elements produced the need of having those feelings expressed and I found them transformed into poetry written in simple verses as a way to eloquently communicate;
Winter, with your longest nights,
with the whiteness of the snow,
with the naked tress resisting
the chilly winds and the cold,
to You, I would like to thank
for writing my Winter songs,
as the poetry  expressed here
is the fruit of my hard work,
it is the living expression
of my emotions and love." />

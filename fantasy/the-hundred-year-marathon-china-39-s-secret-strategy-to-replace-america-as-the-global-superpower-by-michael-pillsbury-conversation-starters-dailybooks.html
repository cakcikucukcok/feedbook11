&lt;br /&gt;
China has a plan to take over the United States as a world leader and will fully accomplish this by 2049 when it celebrates its 100th founding anniversary. According to Chinese teachings, Americans are barbarians who are engineering their own demise. The US has unwittingly helped the Chinese achieve their dream of becoming a world power. The past forty years have seen America aiding China in its economic development as well as providing military and scientific expertise. &amp;quot;We believed that American aid to a fragile China whose leaders thought like us would help China become a democratic and peaceful power without ambitions of regional or even global dominance.&amp;rdquo; This belief is no longer true says former senior national security officer Michael Pillsbury.&lt;br /&gt;
The Hundred-Year Marathon is a Washington Post #1 national bestseller written by Pillsbury who is the Director of the Hudson Institute&amp;rsquo;s Center on Chinese Strategy.&lt;br /&gt;

EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;

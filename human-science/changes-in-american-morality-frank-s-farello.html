  <title>Changes in American Morality - Frank S. Farello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;CHANGES IN AMERICAN MORALITY: OF THE PEOPLE; BY THE PEOPLE; FOR THE SELF&lt;/i&gt;, contends that America has lost touch with the fundamental ethics of its founding principles. This, coupled with the deleterious effects of individualism; liberalism; materialism, and relegating religion to the fringes of the public forum, has undermined Americas achievement of a truly common good.  The result is a serious deterioration of our former collectively conceived moral compass in favor of a more personally composed moral code. This code often blurs the boundaries between right and wrong as the attainment of an unbridled self-satisfaction takes precedence above all else. Therefore, America has become a nation of competing individuals, each seeking to extract ever-increasing levels of personal pleasure and fulfillment from every possible source, often at the expense of our collective civil and social associations; our local communitieseven our families.
&lt;p&gt;     With the works of the Founders and many of Americas recent and modern social thinkers as references, Mr. Farello achieves a thorough examination and explanation of the evolution of many of Americas current social ills, and arrives at a number of solid solutions to those problems. This book is must reading for anyone concerned with American societys current direction." />

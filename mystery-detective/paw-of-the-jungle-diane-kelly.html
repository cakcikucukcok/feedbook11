  <title>Paw of the Jungle - Diane Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Police officer Megan Luz and her K-9 partner in crime, Brigit, are on all fours as they try to solve their latest Lone Star mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;AT THE ZOO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The weather is beautiful, work is slow, and her canine colleague could use a walk. What better day for Megan to take Brigit to the Fort Worth Zoo, where they can let loose and witness the law and order of nature unfold? But what begins as a fun field trip turns serious when a pair of rare hyacinth macaws named Fabiana and Fernando goes missing. Is the new custodian, a gentle soul who happens to be an ex-convict, to blame? Or is something far more sinister afoot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;AND ON THE HUNT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The birds are worth thousands of dollars, and the list of people on the premises who might have stolen them is long. Soon other animals start disappearing. . .and Megan and Brigit have their hands and paws full of suspects. But when a rare black rhino is taken from the zoo, presumably for its black-market-friendly horn, time is of the essence. Can Megan and Brigit find out who&#39;s behind the mystery--before they too become prey? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Funny and acerbic... perfect for lovers of Janet Evanovich.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Librarian and Reviewer &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

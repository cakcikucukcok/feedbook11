  <title>Extra Credit - Maggie Barbieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alison Bergeron has her doubts about hosting a birthday party for her twin stepdaughters, seeing as it&#39;ll include all of her new husband&#39;s ex-in-laws. Still, she&#39;s a good sport, and everyone has a great time, especially the girls, who receive $10,000 from their estranged uncle, Chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girls&#39; father, NYPD Detective Bobby Crawford, and Christine, his ex, think the gift is too much. When Crawford swings by Chick&#39;s apartment to return it, he finds Chick dead, with roughly $250,000 stuffed in his mattress. The death is ruled a suicide, but Christine isn&#39;t convinced, and even Alison can&#39;t help but admit that there must be a lot more to Chick&#39;s death than meets the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extra Credit&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in Maggie Barbieri&#39;s stellar Murder 101 series, finds Alison and Bobby delving into family secrets they&#39;d both rather leave untouched.&lt;/p&gt;" />

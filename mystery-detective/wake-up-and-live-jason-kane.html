  <title>Wake Up and Live - Jason Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Throwing caution to the wind is rarely a good decision, but Taylor Shaw finds himself close to panic and out of options. Time is not on his side. All of his life he has relied on carefully weighing his choices before he acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The story of Taylor Shaw is about being abandoned by his mother, while still a young boy. Shaw makes his way through life by pure instinct and ingenuity, battling personal issues of insecurity and anger. Being raised in poverty in a Mexican environment of East Los Angeles, Shaw must deal with hardships and challenges of race, drugs, gangs and crime.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One evening, Shaw stumbles by chance into a blood-curdling encounter and is fortunate to survive, but his memory of the event is lost. For twenty-five years, his memory remains blocked until a quirk of fate finds him in a life-threatening coma, fighting to regain consciousness and the will to wake up and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Facing the challenge to come out of his coma, Shaw determines he must find a way to travel back to his youth and uncover hidden secrets of his long lost memory. While in a coma, Shaw mysteriously acquires new unexplained mental powers that allow him to find a path back to his youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Taylor Shaw&amp;rsquo;s uplifting life story is full of thrills as he triumphs over incredible odds and heart-wrenching experiences. His journey back to his youth challenges your imagination as it delves into and weaves mysteries and possibilities of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Secrets of a Fashion Therapist: What You Can Learn Behind the Dressing Room Door - Betty Halbreich, Sally Wadyka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Betty Halbreich, the director of Solutions at world-famous specialty store Bergdorf Goodman, brings her shopping and dressing expertise to readers in this bestselling classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting dressed every morning probably causes more trauma than anything else we do on a daily basis. No one understands this better than Betty Halbreich. She&amp;#39;s seen firsthand that putting on clothes is as much&amp;#8212;if not more&amp;#8212;about the mind as it is about the body. Each day, her dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman is filled with women searching for something. They may think they&amp;#39;re merely shopping for a new dress, but, as Betty knows, sometimes they&amp;#39;re really shopping for a whole new life. Whatever these women are seeking, Betty is sure to help them find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With simple instructions and witty asides, Betty takes her experience out of the dressing room and puts it into readers&amp;#39; hands. Follow her through the years and through the stores as she sheds light on such fashion conundrums as how to break up with the color black, what to wear on &amp;#34;Casual Fridays,&amp;#34; what &amp;#34;black-tie&amp;#34; really means, and how to wear just about any accessory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betty elevates shopping and dressing to an art form, yet she makes you realize how simple it really is to look fabulous. She is truly a fashion therapist, dispensing wisdom, wit, and advice on how to enhance your natural beauty, build a more confident self-image, and, most of all, have a little fun while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 200 black-and-white illustrations&lt;/p&gt;" />

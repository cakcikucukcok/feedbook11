My message for the reader:&lt;/p&gt;
My dear Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
Soon we will be entering the most wonderful season of Advent. For the Christian Church, this is the beginning of the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
First, I would ask that you make a point to enter into the spirit of Advent. The word advent is Latin for a coming or arrival. The idea behind it is that God came to earthly
life and lived among us. It is something to celebrate and rejoice. Advent is also a season of preparation. In Advent, we thank God for Christs first coming, prepare for his final coming at the end of time, and celebrate Christs presence among us today through the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
Second, I would encourage you to find the time to be in church. Many people feel that Christmas has been hijacked by popular culture. For me, I love all of the secular songs and traditions. However, without the foundation of knowing and believing that Christ is at the center of Advent, the rest becomes unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
Third, this little book is a Christmas devotional divided into twenty-eight short chapters. I would encourage you not to read ahead. Take a minute each day to follow the adventures of ... Wait a minute, I better stop or I will spoil the story for you. (I hope youre not one of those people who jump to the end to read the last chapter first.)&lt;/p&gt;
Fourth, I hope that in some way this story will help you on your journey to greet the newborn king.&lt;/p&gt;
Fifth, have a joy-filled and safe Advent and Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
Pax,&lt;/br&gt;

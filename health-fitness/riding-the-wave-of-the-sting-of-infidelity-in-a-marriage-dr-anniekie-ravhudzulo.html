  <title>Riding the Wave of the Sting of Infidelity in a Marriage - Dr Anniekie Ravhudzulo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marriage is under tremendous assault as
never before. Will marriage survive? Can
it survive? Infi delity is exploding, but why?
In most cultures, infi delity has become
a major part of entertainment. We all
see it in popular television programs and
movies. Infi delity to some is enjoyment
and pleasure. Some men think if they are
not slipping and cheating they are not
being real men. Some individuals grew up
in environments where cheating is a way
of life. Some women think life is boring
without the excitement of an outside affair. In spite of the reasons, God to
His creation says No to infi delity. Become the good husband or wife you
would like your spouse to be.
Life has taught me that men and women get involved in an extramarital
affair for many different reasons. Sometimes when you are unsatisfi ed
with your relationship you start to think What is available out there? In a
way it is an escape, people feel like they want to be out from the burden
in their marriages. Grass is greener on the other side and so it seems.
I have seen many starting to fl irter with others, innocently at fi rst. They
start to THINK of what ifs situations such as what if Im married to this
friend of mine? Many people forget that slowly they bring themselves
into an extramarital affair and become trapped to another crisis. Let me
remind you that trust is like a balloon. One pricks it, is gone! The fear
of broken promises, cheating or betrayal can reduce the quality of your
marriage. Marriage is a challenging an enterprise that requires hard work,
determination and discipline. Creating a strong and satisfying marriage is
possible, and it is defi nitely worth the effort! Recovery after infi delity is not
an easy path, but if others could pull through, so can you!" />

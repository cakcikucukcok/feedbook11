  <title>The Essential Spirit: Providing Wholistic Services to and with Older Adults - Donald R. Koepke, Charles Fahey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone who provides services to older adults believes in the biomedical model that addresses the body, mind, and spirit of their clients. On the whole, service providers--be they long-term care professionals, academics, social workers, program professionals, counselors, or even clergy--are quite adept at dealing with the body and the mind. But few understand the essential role of the client&#39;s spiritual perspective, which can enhance and make their services and ministries more effective. The Essential Spirit provides such a viewpoint: 1) by exploring a definition of spirituality that is inclusive of both religious and non-religious understandings; and 2) addressing the viewpoints of professionals from a variety of viewpoints. Recognizing that the experience of spirituality is personal and qualitative, The Essential Spirit adds another voice to the ongoing dialogue among professionals and clergy." />

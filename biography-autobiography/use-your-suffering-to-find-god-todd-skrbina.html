  <title>Use Your Suffering to Find God - Todd Skrbina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spirit and I wrote this book to help bring spiritual awareness into peoples lives, and to share my story of what I have learned spiritually. All the suffering I have had in my life has been a real blessing. Suffering is one of the greatest things that can happen to us, it brings us closer to God. I have learned a lot about what the Catholic Church is hiding. The biggest secret the church doesnt want you know is that finding God is an individual right not an institutional one. If you want to find God through Jesus message it is with meditation and deep prayer. The purpose of life is to find God within yourself. We are all gods, I like to call us little gs. I hope my message will help people start their own spiritual path. I hope we can all find God together. God bless!&lt;/p&gt;" />

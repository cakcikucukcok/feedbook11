A picture is taken, capturing the moment. It becomes a symbol; of help freely given and of the hope of the survivors. The faces in the picture cannot be recognised, and that is how Ben likes it. No celebrity, thanks not required.&lt;br /&gt;
But others believe that being identified as the person in the picture is their path to fame and fortune.&amp;nbsp; Ben stands, unknowingly, in their way, but nothing a contract killing cannot fix.&lt;/p&gt;" />

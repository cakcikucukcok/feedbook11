  <title>The Handy Philosophy Answer Book - Naomi Zack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;What is philosophy? Why do I need to know about such-and-such or so-and-so? And what about those famously odd philosophers?   From the introduction: &quot;In Greek, which was the first language of Western Philosophy, &amp;#147;philosophy&amp;#8221; means love of wisdom. One loves wisdom by trying to figure out what it is. So philosophy is an activity of seeking wisdom.  There are many ways human beings seek wisdom, which include art, religion, and lived experience. Philosophy is distinct because it seeks wisdom through the systematic use of reason. Philosophers focus on ideas, the meaning of ideas, and beliefs, by analyzing them.&quot;  The Handy Philosophy Answer Book explores various truths and wisdoms, the history of philosophy, schools of thought, and the background and quirks of famous philosophers. Plus, how changing philosophical thought effected the history of civilization. How philosophy effects pop culture, politics and government, and our everyday lives. You&amp;#8217;ll learn answers to such questions as . . .  Why did the Pythagorians avoid fava beans? What were Socrates&amp;#8217; most influential Philosophical Beliefs? How was skepticism related to the scientific revolution? What were the most noteworthy advances in medicine during the scientific revolution? Was Kierkegaard &amp;#147;cursed&amp;#8221;? What was Nietzsche&amp;#8217;s idea of a &amp;#147;gay science?&amp;#8221;  What was the Enlightenment? Who was David Hume? How did A. J. Ayer defeat Mike Tyson? What is racism? What are the philosophical issues about racial identity? What is Native American Philosophy? How is Confucianism relevant to contemporary Western philosophy?&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

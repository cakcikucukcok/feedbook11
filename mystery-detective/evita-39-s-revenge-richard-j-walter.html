  <title>Evita&#39;s Revenge - Richard J. Walter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this thrilling sequel to the author&#39;s Twisted Tango, former OSS officer Pete Benton finds himself in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1951, working for a Department of Justice task force investigating organized crime. When a member of the task force is found near dead from a brutal beating, Pete and his wife Mara are confronted with the possibility that they might be next to suffer from an attack. But a greater danger lurks when the Bentons unknowingly become the targets of revenge from the powerful first lady of Argentina, Evita Pern, still bitter over Pete&#39;s efforts to spy on her and Juan Pern six years earlier. David Friedman, the man who recruited Benton in Buenos Aires, is now working for the Central Intelligence Agency, continuing his relentless pursuit of Nazi war criminals. In that effort, Friedman himself is recruited by a beautiful Israeli intelligence officer to provide information on Nazi war criminals relocated by the CIA to the United States. Reunited in the nation&#39;s capital, the Bentons and Friedman find themselves caught up in a tangled web of intrigue, deceit, betrayal, and revenge that puts them all in peril." />

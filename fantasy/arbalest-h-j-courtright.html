  <title>Arbalest - H. J. Courtright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the siege of Castle Ahryz, an infant prince is rescued by a servant and a trusted guard. The prince is raised as a peasant. Years later, after their home is plundered by minions of the evil King Luther, the prince is thrust upon the path to regain his kingdom.
Prince Jerrod acquires a mysterious silvery-white stallion, whom he names Arbalest, and he, and several loyal to his cause, set out to claim the throne that is his by right. The attempt is thwarted. As they flee, Jerrod is mortally wounded. Unconscious, he has a vision of the Horn, a weapon of magic that derives its power from the moon.
Healed by what is looked upon as a miracle, Jerrod comes to believe that only the Horn has the power to defeat Luther. He and his companions set out in quest of the mysterious castle said to be the Horns sanctuary.
Nearly consumed in a blizzard, they are led to the castle through the unerring senses of Arbalest. But soon after, Jerrod discovers the magic he so deeply desires to possess is not without consequence." />

  <title>The Psychopath Will See You Now - Graham Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;History is full of surprises. This book is about some of the big ones of the recent past, be they political upheavals, wars and atrocity or famine and diseases of mass destruction. But we also note the humor, or sense of the ridiculous, that is a key ingredient of the human experience. Trying to make sense of events as they occur is traditionally the job of the foreign correspondent, the man or woman on the ground. In a fast-moving collection of articles we travel the world with the author as he covers many major events, observing at first hand the end of apartheid, the fall of the Soviet empire, the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia, conflict in the Middle East, the reunification of Germany, the last quirky remnants of the imperial era, the hunt for the source of the AIDS virus, the origins of the crisis in the European Union, the horrors of the narcotics trade, the lifestyles of tyrants, royalty and those who live at the edge of the world. Through it all we experience the extraordinary individuals who shape history for good or for evil, or who entertain us through their exceptional personalities and ambitions. This is a rollicking journey of discovery through a world that never ceases to excite, amuse, astonish or dismay.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Ordinary Magic - Thomas Quealy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;I&gt;ORDINARY MAGIC&lt;/I&gt; Jack Daly, atheist and movie &#39;special effects&#39; expert, creates holograms of Jesus and famous saints to preach the Sunday sermon at Holy Redeemer Church in a last ditch effort to keep the poor parish out of bankruptcy. Tickets to the service cost up $250 each. His uncle, Fr. Frank Shymanski, the pastor, is tormented over this as he believes they are committing a sacrilege against God and will be severely punished for it.&lt;/p&gt;
Bizarre murders soon take place. A policeman is levitated to his death in the church. An altar boy is mortally torched by a blast of psychokinetic energy. A beautiful woman is strangled in a Black Mass ritual at a synagogue by a killer who can be in two places at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
Rabbi Ari Zabel, a student of &lt;I&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/I&gt;, is asked by the NYPD to consult on the strange case as the killer seemingly has mystical powers similar to those possessed by certain prophets in the &lt;I&gt;Bible&lt;/I&gt;. The evidence points to a Demon as the likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
In a climactic confrontation at St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, the killer&#39;s formidable powers are pitted against Jack&#39;s &#39;special effects&#39; movie magic and the sparks fly.&lt;/p&gt;" />

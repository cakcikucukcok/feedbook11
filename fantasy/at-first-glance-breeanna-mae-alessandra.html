  <title>At First Glance - Breeanna Mae Alessandra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world where time does not exist and cultural structure is fragile at best, a life will be changed by a stroke of luck and misfortune. Lives lost and lives anew will disrupt the flow of nature, twisting reality to the very point of breakage. Harlow Grimm is a young beautiful girl living as a poor peasant in a rural of a time that is now forgotten. She lives a modest, chaste, and innocent life every day humming about, living day to day with not a particular care in the world. She is in love, or so she thinks. Her mother has a secret, but her father is greedy and ruins the plan. When Jafar, a Prince with a dark lust, decides that he wants Harlow, neither her mother nor her fianc had the power to overcome the influence of dirty money. Harlows story is complicated. By a twist of fate, she would meet a man she did not understand and as Harlow begins to discover her true destiny, she falls. 
Sometimes losing her mind, her journey over a short time, brings her to places she never thought she would go. In war, she conquered. In life, she shone. In love, she soared. Harlow Grimm is the brightest star. Merely a child, she faces adult situation and her doomed existence, knowing her nemesis is life itself. The writing on the wall, they say, is often seen, but we assume that writing is meant for someone else. Harlow had to see that it was her writing. She was forced to see that she was not just Harlow Grimm of Dash. In this story you will see that making judgments and rash decisions will lead you to sure demise. Nothing is ever as it seems, at first glance." />

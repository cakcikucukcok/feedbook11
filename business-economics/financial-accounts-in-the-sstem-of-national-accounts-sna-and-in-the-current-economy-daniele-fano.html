Financial Accounts
in the System of National Accounts (SNA) and  in the Current Economy
«Daniele Fano is one of the best experts in financial accounts. Beyond insider information on concepts and methodology, his book is an insightful contribution into various potential uses of national accounts for a better understanding of savings and indebtedness behaviors. I recommend this book to both beginners and  advanced researchers of this subject».
Didier Davydoff,
Director of the European Savings Institute, Paris
«Even before the financial crisis that started in May 2007- with no doubts the most severe after the Second World War- it should have been clear that understanding  financial flows and stocks was crucial. However, the crisis brought the issue to the forefront. 
We are thus particularly proud  to be able to provide our students with a systematic and rigorous approach to macro-financial statistics. On their side, the students consider the course as a unique opportunity to have a well equipped “bag of tools”».

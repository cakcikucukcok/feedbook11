  <title>Silinski - Edgar Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace (1875-1932) was a prolific British crime writer, journalist and playwright, who wrote 175 novels, 24 plays, and countless articles in newspapers and journals. Over 160 films have been made of his novels, more than any other author. In the 1920s, one of Wallace’s publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. Silinski is one of Edgar Wallace’s more over-the-top master fiends. He could teach Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley something about stock manipulation. Silinski and a group of gangster financiers make havoc with the markets, cause devastating financial turmoil. The action becomes ever more outrageous from there." />

  <title>Graysville - Shirley Brock Turney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the history of Graysville, Georgia, during the time of the Indians and the Civil War. It is about the hardship of life back in the 1900s. It is a time when the Indians roamed the creek banks, hunting and fishing. They lived a peaceful life until the Indian Removal Act was enforced in 1838, and they had to leave their ancestral home. Mr. Gray brought the railroad through Graysville, and it became a thriving little town until Gen. Sherman marched through, destroying everything. It is also a collection of poems, childhood memories, and life in a simpler time, growing up in a Southern town during the fifties. It is a journey through by-gone days and life as a young child growing up in a community of extraordinary people." />

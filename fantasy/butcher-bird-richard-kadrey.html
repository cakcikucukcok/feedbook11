  <title>Butcher Bird - Richard Kadrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong &gt;Butcher Bird, an early protoype for dark urban fantasy from the New York Times bestselling author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;I&gt;Sandman Slim&lt;/I&gt;, is reissued in a special tenth anniversary edition.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Spyder Lee is a happy man. He lives in San Francisco and owns a tattoo shop. He has his favorite drinking buddy, Lulu Garou, and other friends all over town. One night a pissed-off demon tries to bite his head off and he&amp;#39;s saved by a stranger?a small, blind woman with a sword as wicked as her smile. After that, Spyder&amp;rsquo;s life is turned upside down.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The demon infected Spyder with something awful?the truth. He can suddenly see the world as it really is: full of angels and demons and monsters and monster-hunters; a world full of black magic and mysteries. These are the Dominions, parallel worlds full of wonder, beauty and horror, of which Spyder&amp;rsquo;s is only one. Each Dominion is home to another race of creatures from human myth. If you&amp;rsquo;re clever or lucky, you can pass from one Dominion to another, but the Dominions themselves never touch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; At least, they&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to. The Black Clerks, infinitely old and infinitely powerful beings whose job it is to keep the Dominions in balance, seem to have new interests and a whole new agenda. Dropped into the middle of a conflict between the Black Clerks and other forces he doesn&amp;#39;t fully understand, Spyder searches for a magic book with the blind swordswoman who saved him. Their journey will take them from deserts to lush palaces, to underground caverns, to the heart of Hell itself." />

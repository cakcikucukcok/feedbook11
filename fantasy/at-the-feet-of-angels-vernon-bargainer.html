  <title>At the Feet of Angels - Vernon Bargainer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the tale of Jenny Burnett, a young child, kidnapped by her uncle and sold on the black market to a childless couple. It is the compelling drama of Jenny&#39;s endless pining for her real mother, of her instinctive, yet daring, attempts to escape, of growing abuse at the hands of her adoptive mother, and of the hapless effort of a sympathetic but inept adoptive father. It is a story of the child&#39;s quest for salvation in her play, in the enduring friendship she strikes with a little neighbor boy she never gets to see, and in daydreams of angels and fairies she wills into the sky above her prison playground.&lt;p&gt;
 The story takes place inside the heart and mind of the little prisoner and reveals her every impulse: her dreams, her hopes, her fears, her anger, her confusion, her prayers and her attempts to reason. It is a tale of struggle and play, of compelling innocence, of times of soaring joy, of special friendship, and of poignant memories and determined effort." />

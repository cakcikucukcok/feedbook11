  <title>The Eet Defeat - Jason Haerich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is so exciting to move to a new town and begin class at a new school.  If it wasn&#39;t for that pesky fifth grade teacher trying to dispatch the students, this town would be really awesome!    There are so many things a kid has to do when moving to a new house and starting a new school.  You have to meet new friends, get all your school supplies... and avoid the teacher who wants to put you in an iron maiden.  Only the merest façade of normalcy cloaks the town of Smithville.  Underneath lies a cauldron of grisly characters and grim possibilities, especially for the children of the Mark family who just moved to town.  Talon, the clever 5th grader, is deeply embroiled in a plot to uncover the secret of the nefarious fifth grade teacher bent on his destruction.  Join Talon and his new batch of eclectic and oddly familiar friends as they discover the mystery of the infamous Mr. Eet." />

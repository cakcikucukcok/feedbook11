  <title>Stolen Stripes and Broken Medals - Dr. Muhammad Anwar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;Stolen Stripes and Broken Medals&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt; is a true account of the life of a Pakistani naval officer who despite reaching the star ranks and with impeccable record of service had to prematurely say good bye to his long military career. In fact those achievements created enemies who ultimately staged the fatal conspiracy when he was at the pinnacle of his career and was just about to get his second star. The title of this book reflects as to how his hard earned stripes were stolen and his medals broken by no one other than the top brass of the Navy since he had refused to tell a lie to safeguard their personal interests.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;She Wasn&#39;t Looking For a Husband &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kansas McClellan was looking for her brother, and Paxton Moore was the only man who could help her. She&#39;d heard he knew the tough, Western landscape like the back of his callused hand, so it didn&#39;t matter that he stirred in her feelings of longing that she&#39;d rather not explore… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He Wasn&#39;t Out to Find a Wife&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Paxton was happy with his life just the way it was, but ever since Kansas barged into town, the sultry days - and hot nights - were getting far too steamy for comfort. But he simply couldn&#39;t resist her. This was one female in distress he couldn&#39;t refuse - even if finding her brother meant losing his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

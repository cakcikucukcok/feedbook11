  <title>Silence Has a Voice - Marvis Pharr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marviss first poetry book, When You Close Your Eyes: A Journey into the Celebration of Life, met with great success and was published by Xlibris Corporation in 2008.
Her latest book, Silence Has a Voice, is a compilation of poems infused with passions, hopes, dreams and life experiences and expresses a wide range of emotions from setbacks to victories. If you listen carefully, she invites, there is a voice in silence: it offers respect; it offers hope; it offers clarity. Many of the poems selected were to honor lost loved ones. Often, during such difficult times, silence is a welcoming presence. 
Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen states it best: Perhaps the most important thing we bring to another person is the silence in us; not the sort of silence that is filled with unspoken criticism or hard withdrawal; the sort of silence that is a place of refuge, of rest, of acceptance of someone as they are; we are all hungry for this other silence; it is hard to find. In its presence we can remember something beyond the moment, a strength on which to build a life. Silence is a place of great power and healing." />

  <title>Living without a Why: Mysticism, Pluralism, and the Way of Grace - Paul O. Ingram, Marit Trelstad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book Paul O. Ingram adds his voice to a long list of writers seeking to relate Christian tradition to the hard realities of this post-Christian age of religious and secular pluralism. As a Lutheran, Ingram thinks grace flows over this universe like a waterfall. So he brings Christian mystical theology into a discussion of the meaning of grace.  Alfred North Whitehead&#39;s philosophical vision provides a language that serves as a hermeneutical bridge by which historians of religions can interpret the teachings and practices of religious Ways other than their own without falsification, and by which theologians can appropriate history-of-religions research as a means of helping Christians advance in their own faith journeys.  The purpose of the journey of faith is what Whitehead called &quot;creative transformation.&quot; The contemporary theological tradition that has most systematically and coherently followed Whitehead&#39;s lead in its reflection on non-Christian Ways is process theology, which is perhaps the only liberal or progressive theological movement now active in the twenty-first century." />

          &lt;strong&gt;Bachelor’s Bought Bride &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attractive, sweet natured…and filthy rich, Bree Kincannon was just the bride ad exec Gavin Spencer had been looking for. And Bree’s father had secretly offered him a cool million, too. It took the bachelor no time to turn the heiress into his loving wife. But when Bree discovered the reason behind Gavin’s whirlwind courtship, the bedroom door was slammed in his face!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;CEO’s Expectant Secretary &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CEO Brock Maddox had been betrayed by his lover. . . his own secretary. And when he finally confronted Elle Linton, he discovered she’d been keeping an even bigger secret. Elle was carrying his baby. Brock declared Elle would marry him. But he was determined that his head would make all his decisions from here on…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;KINGS OF THE BOARDROOM&lt;em&gt; They need the right women to melt their steel-hard hearts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>IQ: A Smart History of a Failed Idea - Stephen Murdoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Advance praise for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IQ A Smart History of a Failed Idea&lt;p&gt;&quot;An up-to-date, reader-friendly account of the continuing saga of the mismeasure of women and men.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Howard Gardner, author of Frames of Mind and Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons&lt;p&gt;&quot;The good news is that you won&#39;t be tested after you&#39;ve read Stephen Murdoch&#39;s important new book. The better news is that IQ: A Smart History of a Failed Idea is compelling from its first pages, and by its conclusion, Murdoch has deftly demonstrated that in our zeal to quantify intelligence, we have needlessly scarred&amp;#151;if not destroyed&amp;#151;the lives of millions of people who did not need an IQ score to prove their worth in the world. IQ is first-rate narrative journalism, a book that I hope leads to necessary change.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Russell Martin, author of Beethoven&#39;s Hair, Picasso&#39;s War, and Out of Silence&lt;p&gt;&quot;With fast-paced storytelling, freelance journalist Murdoch traces now ubiquitous but still controversial attempts to measure intelligence to its origins in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. . . . Murdoch concludes that IQ testing provides neither a reliable nor a helpful tool in understanding people&#39;s behavior, nor can it predict their future success or failure. . . . A thoughtful overview and a welcome reminder of the dangers of relying on such standardized tests.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Publishers Weekly&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stephen Murdoch delivers a lucid and engaging chronicle of the ubiquitous and sometimes insidious use of IQ tests. This is a fresh look at a century-old and still controversial idea&amp;#151;that our human potential can be distilled down to a single test score.  Murdoch&#39;s compelling account demands a reexamination of our mania for mental measurement.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Paul A.

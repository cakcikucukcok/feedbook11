  <title>My Life, My Journey - Bruce Wilberforce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born into a family in difficult circumstances, Bruce Wilberforce finds himself in the streets at a very young age, struggling to eke out a living. Having been taken out of the streets and encouraged by teachers at school, he turned out to be a brilliant student. His first-cycle education earned him a Middle School Leaving Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against his fathers inclination to get him into carpentry, he secretly joins the Teenagers Group after passing an examination. He finally passed out in a batch of last round of recruits, but below his expectation of being assigned to nonadministrative work, he was assigned to administrative duties in the army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His initial enthusiasm for the Avuh coup, which involved past trainees of the Teenagers Group, turned into opposition to it when those colleagues became targets of attacks from the regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then joined the military opposition to Avuh. On one occasion of daring, his conspiratorial group, led by Major Omar Mukhtar, got bombs rained on it. His only way of escape was to rub himself with his own excreta. Having escaped into exile in Kroto, he ended up in Caucasian Republic, where he resumed his education and acquired a masters degree to become a manager.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Great Quest - Matthew Gilbertson, Eric Gilbertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eric and Matthew were born in Berea, KY in 1986 and started hiking with their Dad in the nearby hills and hollers of Kentucky as soon as they could walk.
They started college in the fall of 2004 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Mass, and  discovered the MIT Outing Club. They both graduated in 2008 and  in 2010 with Bachelors and Masters degrees. Since fall 2010, they have been at MIT working on mechanical engineering PhDs and squeezing in state highpoints.
In February 2012 they finished the final state highpoint  Guadalupe Peak in Texas.  They are busy working to finish PhD degrees: Matthew is designing an improved handheld force-controlled ultrasound probe and Eric is working with autonomous kayaks." />

  <title>South Pole Station - Ashley Shelby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Lascaux Prize in Fiction &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Millions&#39; &lt;/i&gt;Most Anticipated Books of the Year &lt;/b&gt;o &lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/i&gt;Editors&#39; Choice&lt;/b&gt; o &lt;b&gt;Named a Best Book of the Year by &lt;i&gt;Shelf Awareness&lt;/i&gt; and One of the Best Environmental Fiction Books of the Year by &lt;i&gt;Earther&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A warmhearted comedy of errors set in the world&#39;s harshest place, Ashley Shelby&#39;s &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Pole Station&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; is a wry and witty debut novel about the courage it takes to band together when everything around you falls apart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have digestion problems due to stress? Do you have problems with authority? How many alcoholic drinks to you consume a week? Would you rather be a florist or a truck driver? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are some of the questions that determine if you have what it takes to survive at South Pole Station, a place with an average temperature of -54°F and no sunlight for six months a year. Cooper Gosling has just answered five hundred of them. Her results indicate she is abnormal enough for Polar life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cooper&#39;s not sure if this is an achievement, but she knows she has nothing to lose. Unmoored by a recent family tragedy, she&#39;s adrift at thirty and--despite her early promise as a painter--on the verge of sinking her career. So she accepts her place in the National Science Foundation&#39;s Artists &amp; Writers Program and flees to Antarctica, where she encounters a group of misfits motivated by desires as ambiguous as her own. The only thing the Polies have in common is the conviction that they don&#39;t belong anywhere else. Then a fringe scientist arrives, claiming climate change is a hoax. His presence will rattle this already-imbalanced community, bringing Cooper and the Polies to the center of a global controversy and threatening the ancient ice chip they call home.&lt;/p&gt;" />

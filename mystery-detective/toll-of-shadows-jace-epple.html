  <title>Toll of Shadows - Jace Epple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A reclusive scientist claims he has built a machine that can bend the rules of time. After a series of tests confirms the device is operable, the world becomes changed in ways that are strange and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sent on a recovery mission, a team of astronauts encounters a hostile alien force. They learn the battlefield that lies before them is not a physical one, but of their minds alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man gains access to a highly coveted ritual normally reserved for a select few. Behind closed doors, he gets much more than he bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a bright summer afternoon, a young couple visits the grave of John Dillinger at Crown Hill Cemetery. When they attempt to leave, the entrance gate has disappeared, and their lives are not what they seemed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a few tales included in Jace Epple&#39;s third installment of suspense and fantasy, Toll of Shadows. Epple delivers a new round of spellbinding fiction, where characters explore landscapes that are wild and unmerciful. In a place where normal meets the unknown, Toll of Shadows is a masterful page-turner. The reading lamp will stay on well past the midnight hour.&lt;/p&gt;" />

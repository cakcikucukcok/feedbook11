  <title>One Year in Retirement - Martin Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Year in Retirement is a fictionalized memoir covering the year after a 61-year old leaves his civil service job after 27 years. It depicts his experiences in dealing with the question: So youre retired; what do you do now? It shows that some things change in retirement while others dont. It shows that retirement can be a little scary, but that it can also be rewarding. The authors purpose was, first, having published three collections of short stories in each of the past three years, to write a longer piece; and, secondly, to put into it all of the things hes learned about dealing with being retired. As it turned out, this wasnt too much, but he hopes the book will be somewhat instructive as well as entertaining.&lt;p&gt;
The author is still writing short stories; at this time, hes had a little over 200 stories published, most of them in the online magazines he discovered four or five years ago. In addition to A Year in Retirement, hes included in this book 25 short stories that have been published but not collected before." />

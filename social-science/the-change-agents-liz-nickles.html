  <title>The Change Agents - Liz Nickles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What does it mean when decision making has speeded up beyond imagining? When life and work are fused rather than relegated to their own places and times? What about the impact of the serial career on industries built with the expectation that they were training employees for the long haul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on unique research and interviews, &lt;i&gt;The Change Agents&lt;/i&gt; is a clear-eyed examination of what living in a wired world really means to organizational behavior and individual empowerment. The media has been full of stories of the dizzying ascents and fast falls of dot-commers over the last few years, but &lt;i&gt;The Change Agents&lt;/i&gt; shows how the rest of the world -- from top CEOs to the guys in the mailroom -- is irrevocably affected by a paradigm shift as wrenching as the industrial revolution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nickles has identified a self-empowered group she labels &quot;Change Agents&quot; who are demanding more power in the workplace than previous generations were granted after years with a company - and they are getting it. &lt;i&gt;The Change Agents&lt;/i&gt; shows how they do it and why it matters. Backed by exclusive statistical research and scores of personal interviews, &lt;i&gt;Faster Forward &lt;/i&gt;is a revealing and significant look at the future for everyone who works today.&lt;/p&gt;" />

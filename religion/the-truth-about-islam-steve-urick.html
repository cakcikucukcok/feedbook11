It has since grown to almost 1.5 billion followers today and is quickly growing. Islam claims to be a peaceful religion, but is often known to be violent and threatens the freedom of the entire world. What are the teachings of Islam and how does it compare to the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Th e Truth About Islam examines the Quran (Koran), the God of Islam, its pagan origin, the Jesus of Islam, its salvation plan, Sharia law and slavery, and its violent ideology of Jihad against all infi dels (non-Muslims), in light of the Bible and world history.&lt;/p&gt;

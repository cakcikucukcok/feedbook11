  <title>The War Years and the Willard Years: A Memoir of William H. Kauffman, M. D. - Nancy Kauffman, Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Bill Kauffman was an Army physician who served on troop ships during WWII, keeping secret journals so that he could share his experiences with his wife.  He served mainly in the North Atlantic, was part of the invasion of Sicily, and made one 6-month trip around the world.  Doc was an excellent observer, making his journals rich in detail.  His words show his character and sense of humor as well as his compassion.  The second part of the book illustrates his post-war years.  He was one of the last physicians to make house calls in Willard, Ohio, yet he was willing to try new approaches to medicine.  He was active in his community, worked to break down racial barriers in the early 1960s, and had a great sense of humor.  He helped colleagues in The Netherlands after the war and provided a home for 2 young men from Cuba.  He was an avid fisherman, a pilot, and a poker player." />

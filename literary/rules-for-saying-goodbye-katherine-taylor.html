  <title>Rules for Saying Goodbye - Katherine Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kath is curious,&quot; observes her younger brother, Ethan, not without anxiety. She is thirteen; already everyone can see she&#39;s got her eye on bigger things than provincial Fresno can offer. Years in the glamorous chill of an East Coast prep school will introduce her to a razor-sharp sense of social distinction, cocaine &quot;so good it&#39;s pink,&quot; and an indispensable best friend--all that she needs to prepare for life in Manhattan. There will be fourteen-dollar cocktails but no money for groceries; unsuitable men of enormous charm, and unsuitable jobs of no charm at all; and a wistful yearning for a transformation from someone of promise into someone of genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this deliciously witty and affecting debut novel, fiction winks at real life: Katherine Taylor is its muddled heroine, and also its author. Written in the tradition of Curtis Sittenfeld and Melissa Bank, with the gorgeous hues of a pile of Gatsby&#39;s shirts, &lt;i&gt;Rules for Saying Goodbye &lt;/i&gt;is a bittersweet yet comic coming-of-age tale that has an unerring feel for the delights and malaises of a generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />

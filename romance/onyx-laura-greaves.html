  <title>Onyx - Laura Greaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever defied a pharaoh to run off with a prince?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever fallen for a customer who buys beautiful flowers every week but appears unattached?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever lusted after a colleague knowing the world would condemn you for it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this year&amp;rsquo;s collection of short stories where lost dogs can unite strangers, the death of a loved one really can be a blessing in disguise and a fallen woman does what she must to protect a family member, Romance Writers of Australia&amp;rsquo;s best of the best for 2017 prove onyx stands for love, for hope, and for happy endings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Little Gems Short Story competition is a mainstay of the RWA contest year. Although it commenced in 2004 with Ruby, the anthology has been produced in its present form since Pearl 2008. Competition to be included in the annual anthology is fierce resulting in a very fine selection of romantic stories from all romance subgenres. Judging is rigorous with each entry read by three judges and scored for writing technique, character development, and the elusive X Factor. The stories must include the current year gem, Onyx for 2017, be under 3000 words and rated sweet to mild in sexual content. Our judges never cease to be amazed and delighted by the creativity and variety of entries within those guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to stop at just one.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Third Daughter - Eileen O&#39;Mara Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In this moving and elegant self-portrait Eileen O&amp;#8217;Mara Walsh takes us from an unconventional Limerick childhood to years spent in Dublin, London and Paris, returning to Ireland in the 1970s to pioneer a burgeoning tourism industry. The memoir begins with the marriage of her parents, Power O&amp;#8217;Mara, War of Independence exile, to Joan Follwell, English socialist and proteg&amp;#233;e of Bertrand Russell. As the family falls from middle-class comfort into genteel poverty among the literary and theatrical   gures of 1950s and 60s Dublin, we are o  ered fascinating glimpses of Brendan Behan, Noel Browne, Miche&amp;#225;l Mac Liamm&amp;#243;ir, Conor Cruise O&amp;#8217;Brien and others. Eileen leaves Ireland for London at eighteen, coming of age in her brush with le  -wing groups and then moving to Paris, where she falls in love for the   firrst time with an older French artist. She returns to Dublin in 1962 to the bohemian milieu of painters and writers, among them Patrick Kavanagh, Sean O&amp;#8217;Sullivan, Brian Bourke, Camille Souter and Aidan Higgins. There she meets Mayo painter Owen Walsh, embarking on a lifelong and transformative relationship. The deaths of her parents and sister Ruth are tempered by the birth of her son Eoghan in 1975. She describes how single motherhood galvanized her into establishing her own company and how she found herself at the forefront of Irish corporate life during the 1980s and 90s. These memories yield shrewd and amusing views of politicians encountered along the way &amp;#150; O&amp;#8217;Malley, Haughey, Ahern &amp;#150; as well as the colourful but lesser-known characters who populated the Dublin of that time. This lively record traces the arc of a hundred years of family history, from the birth of her father in 1900 to the death of her great love, Owen Walsh, in 2002. The Third Daughter is a poignant, passionate chronicle of a ful  lled life, lyrically rendered.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>Cognitive Remediation for Psychological Disorders - Alice Medalia, Tiffany Herlands, Alice Saperstein, Nadine Revheim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Individuals with serious and persistent mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and affective disorders, often experience cognitive deficits that make it challenging to perform everyday tasks. For example, they may have difficulty paying attention, remembering and learning, thinking quickly, and solving problems, and this may interfere with functioning at work, school, and in social and living situations. Cognitive remediation is an evidence-based behavioral treatment for people who are experiencing cognitive impairments that interfere with role functioning.
&lt;em&gt;Cognitive Remediation for Psychological Disorders&lt;/em&gt; contains all the information therapists need to set up a cognitive remediation program that helps clients strengthen the cognitive skills necessary for everyday functioning. The program described is called Neuropsychological and Educational Approach to Remediation (NEAR), an evidence-based approach that utilizes carefully crafted instructional techniques which promote learning. The goals of NEAR are to provide a positive learning experience and to promote independent learning and optimal cognitive functioning in daily life.
The second edition of this popular Therapist Guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to implement NEAR techniques with patients. Guidelines for setting up and running a successful cognitive remediation program are laid out in an easy-to-follow format. Therapists will learn how to choose appropriate cognitive exercises, recruit and work with clients, perform intakes, and create treatment plans. This Guide comes complete with all the tools necessary for facilitating treatment, including program evaluation forms and client handouts." />

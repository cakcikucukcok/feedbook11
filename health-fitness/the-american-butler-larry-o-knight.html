  <title>The American Butler - Larry O. Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content=":&quot;For most of us, the wacky, wonderful world of butlering, is very mysterious -
but no - it is not about answer phones and standing about the door ready to greet or shoo away. 
Rather it is alot like being a well paid waiter, nanny, chauffer and sometimes &quot;handsholder&quot; and much, much more.
This book is part instructional, autobiographical and a meshmash of fun facts and figures I felt you
might enjoy.  It was written for the would-be butler, the working butler, people who have butlers and
the mildly or wildly curious.
In most American households, the wife runs that house and thus, that butler.  The house need not be
big (I mean 40 bedrooms big).  When I worked for Mrs. Edgar Bergen in Beverly Hills, we had a modest
three-bedroom house, nice yard with pool.  When I worked for Mrs. Jack Warner - the place was
hugh but there was lots of staff and I was not the only butler.
So, you see, each situation had its own story - some good, some great and some not so either one.
I have enjoyed writing this book very much.  I brought back some lovely memories of some very
lovelly ladies and gentlemen I have had the privildge of being of service to." />

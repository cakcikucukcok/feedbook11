  <title>Tagging Along with Muffy - Larry Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tagging Along with Muffy is the storied tale of a little toy poodle who rides with her owner on a recumbent bicycle. She has ridden over twenty-five thousand miles during a period of about fifteen years at the time of this writing. Her story is told through her eyes as she journeyed along these many miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuckle with Muffy as she is chased by an big angry German shepherd, attacked by a mother goose, is drenched in a thunderstorm, and experiences a flat tire many miles from her home. Ride with her through our flood-ravaged town after a major river overflows its banks. Laugh at Muffy as she sneaks into her mommys purse and runs off with a loot of cash! Feel the panic of her owner after she runs away from home. Cringe with her as she avoids being the victim of a car crash. These are but a few of the stories we will share in Tagging Along with Muffy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Muffy and I rode along, I was amazed at how many smiles of delight I witnessed as we encountered other cyclists passing by. I remember in particular one little boy who exclaimed to his mother, Mommy, there is a real doggie on that bike! A friend of mine with whom we often ride, told me one day that someone stopped him on the trail and asked him, Wheres your dog? He has a bike similar to mine. Comments like these encouraged me to put into print our little story of Tagging Along with Muffy. We hope you and your children will be delighted by them too.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The C. J. Box Collection - C.J. Box</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here together for the first time in a convenient ebook bundle, four thrilling mysteries from Edgar Award-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author C.J. Box: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue Heaven&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A twelve-year-old girl and her younger brother are on the run in the Idaho woods, pursued by four men they have just watched commit murder. Retired policemen from Los Angeles, the killers easily persuade the local sheriff to let them lead the search for the missing children. Now there&#39;s nowhere left for William and Annie to hide...and no one they can trust. Until they meet Jess Rawlins. Rawlins is only one against four men who will stop at nothing to silence their witnesses. But in this thrilling mystery novel from C.J. Box, these ex-cops don&#39;t know just how far Rawlins will go to protect William and Annie...and see that justice is done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three Weeks to Say Goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Jack and Melissa McGuane have spent years trying to have a baby. Finally their dream has come true with the adoption of their daughter, Angelina. But nine months after bringing her home, they receive a devastating phone call...Angelina&#39;s birth father, a teenager, never signed away his parental rights-and he wants her back. Worse, his father, a powerful Denver judge, will use every trick in the book to make sure it happens. The McGuanes attempt to meet face-to-face with the father and son...but soon it becomes clear that there&#39;s something sinister about their motivations-and that love for Angelina is not one of them. A horrifying game of intimidation and double crosses begins that quickly becomes a death spiral where everyone is suspect and no one is safe. Now Jack and Melissa will stop at nothing to protect their child-even though time is running out...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back of Beyond&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cody Hoyt, although a brilliant cop, is an alcoholic struggling with two months of sobriety when his friend Hank Winters turns up dead in a remote mountain cabin. At first it looks like the suicide of a man who&#39;s fallen off the wagon, but Cody knows Hank better than that. As Cody digs deeper into the case, all roads lead to foul play. After years of bad behavior with his department, Cody in no position to be investigating a homicide. But he will stop at nothing to find out who murdered Hank. And why...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Highway&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When two sisters set out across a remote stretch of Montana road to visit their friend, little do they know it will be the last time anyone might ever hear from them again. The girls--and their car--simply vanish. Former police investigator Cody Hoyt has just lost his job and has fallen off the wagon after a long stretch of sobriety. Convinced by his son and his former rookie partner, Cassie Dewell, he begins the drive south to the girls&#39; last known location. As Cody makes his way to the lonely stretch of Montana highway where they went missing, Cassie discovers that Gracie and Danielle Sullivan aren&#39;t the first girls who have disappeared in this area. This majestic landscape is the hunting ground for a killer whose viciousness is outmatched only by his intelligence. And he might not be working alone. Time is running out for Gracie and Danielle...Can Cassie overcome her doubts and lack of experience and use her innate skill? Can Cody Hoyt battle his own demons and find this killer before another victim vanishes on the highway?&lt;/p&gt;" />

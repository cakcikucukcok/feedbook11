  <title>Journal of a Mad Man: The Wisdom of Ecclesiastes - Derrick  McCarson, Dennis Thurman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the meaning of life? The question has been asked by the brightest philosophical minds for centuries. Still to this day answers vary greatly depending on the worldview. Solomon, the wisest king in Israel&#39;s history, set all his energies to search for the ultimate meaning of life under the sun. His conclusions may shock and surprise you--vanity, chasing after the wind, absurdity, vanishing smoke. Are these the musings of a genius or of a mad man?  If you are looking for a candy-coated appraisal of life then go ahead and put this book down. However, if you are looking for a no-frills, brutally honest, ragged-edged assessment of reality, then you have discovered an indispensable volume.  In Journal of a Mad Man, pastor and author Derrick McCarson will carefully guide readers verse by verse through Solomon&#39;s meditations recorded in the Old Testament book of wisdom--Ecclesiastes. Not only will readers attempt to plumb the depths of some of mankind&#39;s most vexing questions, but they will also discover Solomon&#39;s secrets for wise living in a warped world." />

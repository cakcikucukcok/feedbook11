  <title>American Detective - Loren D. Estleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Loren D. Estleman&#39;s hardboiled &lt;i&gt;American Detective&lt;/i&gt;, Amos Walker returns for his nineteenth outing in his most challenging case yet. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex-Detroit Tigers pitcher Darius Fuller wants Walker to break off his daughter&#39;s engagement to Hilary Bairn, a man he believes is after her two million dollar trust. Walker goes to Bairn&#39;s apartment, only to be ambushed by cops. A murder has taken place, and the victim is Fuller&#39;s daughter. Walker and the cops assume that Bairn is the murderer, but Walker has no idea what he is getting into. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker is led to a meeting with a casino owner, who tells him Bairn owed money to a loan shark. The loan shark tells Walker that he is not the only one after Bairn.  Soon Walker finds himself on the run from crooked cops and vile gangsters. Every time Walker thinks he&#39;s solved the case, he finds out he is farther from the truth than when he started. This case will take all of Walker&#39;s cunning, and will prove to be his greatest trial ever!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

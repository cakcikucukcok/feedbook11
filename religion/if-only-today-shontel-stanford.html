  <title>If Only Today - Shontel Stanford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a time where most of the world is struggling to find hope a word of encouragement is long overdue. People are longing for love and acceptance yet with all that they have they still struggle with an emptiness that they are searching to fill. I have found myself in that very same search until I found my love, Jesus Christ.
If Only Today is a collection of 366 short messages to give you hope and inspire you to draw closer to the Lord. You will find joy and peace in the truth that Gods love is unending and all He wants is to be close to you.
These messages kept me strong through my period of homelessness. Theyve given me peace and conformation from God on days I was struggling to give it all to Him. They helped me to know I have a right to His promises for me and my children. 
J. Washington
Your daily messages mean the world to me. When Im going through a tough time they brighten up my day. They give me strength, hope, and the power to strive for a stronger relationship with God.

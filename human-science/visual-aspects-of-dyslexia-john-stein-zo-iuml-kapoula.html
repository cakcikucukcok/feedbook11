  <title>Visual Aspects of Dyslexia - John Stein, Zo&amp;iuml; Kapoula</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dyslexia affects about 10% of all children and is a potent cause of loss of self-confidence, personal and family misery, and waste of potential. Although the dominant view is that it is caused by specifically linguistic/phonological weakness, recent research within the field of neuroscience has shown that it is associated wtih visual processing problems as well. These discoveries have led to a resurgence in visual methods of treatment, which have shown promising
results. 
&#39;Visual aspects of dyslexia&#39; brings together cutting edge research from a range of disciplines - including neurology, neuroscience, and the vision sciences, to present the first comprehensive review of this recent research. It includes chapters from leading specialists which, in addition to reporting on the latest research, show how this knowledge is being successfully applied in the development of effective visual treatments for this common problem. Sections within the book cover the role of
eye movements in reading, visual attention and reading, the neural bases of reading, and the relationship between visual stress and dyslexia.
Making a valuable contribution in helping us develop a deeper understanding of dyslexia, this is an important book for those in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and education.

  <title>BEDROOM OF ADAM AND EVE: CAUSE EFFECT AND SOLUTION - Edward  Kavimba Lungu Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what sin is and what it has done to you and the rest of the people? Does sin bother you? Or do you put the whole blame of sin solely on one man Adam?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book &amp;ndash;&lt;u&gt;Bedroom of Adam and Eve&lt;/u&gt;&amp;mdash;will help you understand that you and the rest of the people in the world are sleeping in the in the bedroom of Adam and eve. Yes all people including myself love to sleep comfortably in the bedroom of Adam and Eve. We naturally know what to do with sin from birth. Nobody tells us how to sin since sin has totally taken control of all our parts of the body. This is called total depravity and this is the Bedroom of Adam and Eve.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only way humans can get out of the comfort of the bedroom of Adam and Eve is to live in the comfort of the bedroom of Jesus Christ. This is possible by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book tells how man and woman came to live in the bedroom of Adam and Eve and how some of the men and women found a way out and started to live in the bedroom of Christ. The bedroom of Adam and Eve also explains what people in the bedroom of Christ came to confess and proclaim throughout Christendom as they walked with the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The target for this book is you who seek to know more about sin and salvation; it is the religious volunteers and chaplains working for the Lord everywhere in the world; It is the convicted people in prison serving time for the crime they have done. Yes, the target of this book is for those wanting to learn more of the protestant Christian values so that they can teach and practice them to their families, friends and churches in the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Real Diamonds &amp; Precious Stones of the Bible - Dr. Pearlie Braswell-Tripp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are 188 women mentioned in the Bible, Old and New Testaments. In my attempt to simplify how we read and interpret a complicated book like the Bible, I am writing things from the Bible in parts. In this book Diamonds, you will read about women that I have compared to jewels. There are Women of Honor, Notable Women, Great Women, Women of Character, Strong Women, Beautiful Women, Famous Women and Infamous Women. These women are true Diamonds In The Rough. I say they are diamonds in the rough because they lived all the way back in the Bible days where women had no rights at all. They could not even speak in the church. They would have to keep silent until they reached home and then talk to men about the service. (1 Cor. 14:34): Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. (1 Cor. 14:35): And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. Some women are polished gemstones, some are natural uncut, unpolished, some are rough, but polished and some are blood diamonds, like Jezebel. You will recognize each gem.
	Women now have an organization named National Organization For Women (NOW). They were organized in 1966. The National Organization for Women is the largest organization of feminist activists in the United States. NOW has more than 500,000 contributing members and more than 500 local and campus affliates in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Since their founding in 1966, Nows goal has been to take action to bring about equality for all women. Both the actions NOW take and its position on the issues are principled, uncompromising and often ahead of their time. NOW is a leader, not a follower, of public opinion." />

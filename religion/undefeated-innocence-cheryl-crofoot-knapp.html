  <title>Undefeated Innocence - Cheryl Crofoot Knapp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you wonder where God is in Alzheimer&#39;s? Are you searching for hope in caregiving? I searched too--I lost both of my parents to Alzheimer&#39;s. They were its innocent victims. Caregiving for someone with Alzheimer&#39;s can be painfully brutal. We know how it ends. There is no cure. It doesn&#39;t get better. But I learned that we don&#39;t have to be defeated by it. And there is much grace and collateral beauty to be found in the journey. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From broken memories to broken bones, Alzheimers catalyzed terror and defeat in my family. My parents were terrorized by the scrambling of their minds. We who loved them had to suffocate our feelings of defeat as they returned to innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a caregiver, God allowed me to share in my parents passages back to undefeated innocence. I gained loving moments that I would have missed if I hadnt been involved and if I hadnt taken up the proper vantage point to see them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Undefeated Innocence offers hope to caregivers by weaving poignant personal experiences, humor, and biblical stories with a study of the Beatitudes. It answers Where is God? in Alzheimers. It confirms that caregiving experiences are abnormally normal, and its okay to store toothpaste in an underwear drawer.
Undefeated Innocence reveals Gods grace through the storms and affirms that caregivers are not alone in wondering if life can return to a place of peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />

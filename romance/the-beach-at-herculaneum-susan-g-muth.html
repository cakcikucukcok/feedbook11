  <title>The Beach at Herculaneum - Susan G. Muth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Daphne is vividly alive, fiery, passionate, hungry for lifeand yet she has been gone for nearly two thousand years. Daphne died in AD 79, when Mount Vesuvius destroyed her seaside town of Herculaneum. Now, she is lost in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne McCarthy has no one. Angry with God, she exists in the present day, but she feels dead inside. Trapped in her unresolved grief over the loss of her husband and five-year-old son in a car accident, she tries to insulate herself from all emotion. But she is haunted by disturbing dreams and visions from another language, time, and place. A priest recommends she take a retreat at a convent, where she hopes she can finally find the peace she needs to move forward. When the dreams become more sinister, Anne decides to travel to Rome for answers, soon realizing that her path to healing has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this moving story, two women separated by centuries but joined in spirit must make a perilous journey together to the edge of death and beyond, as one attempts to right an ancient wrong and the other finds a way to live and love again.&lt;/p&gt;" />

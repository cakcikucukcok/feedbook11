  <title>A Year Between Friends: 3191 Miles Apart - Stephanie Congdon Barnes, Maria Alexandra Vettese, Molly Wizenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;An exploration of 365 days of shared experiences between two friends on opposite sides of the country, inspired by their blog, &lt;I&gt;3191 Miles Apart&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Maria Alexandra Vettese and Stephanie Congdon Barnes share a love of art and design, handmade pleasures, and a well-lived domestic life. Almost a decade ago, they began their first year-long project together, posting a photo from each of their mornings on their blog, &lt;I&gt;3191 Miles Apart&lt;/I&gt;, named for the distance between their homes in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon. &lt;I&gt;3191 Miles Apart&lt;/I&gt; quickly acquired a worldwide following of readers drawn in by the delicate intimacy of their shared experiences.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Year Between Friends&lt;/I&gt; celebrates their most recent project together&amp;mdash;a visual representation of 2015, month-by-month, side-by-side, but miles apart. In addition to 400 photographs recording their daily inspirations and creative undertakings and a foreword from &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author Molly Wizenberg, this unique collaboration expands on their prior work with over 25 handmade crafts and seasonal recipes, notes on simple living, and personal stories that follow the tide of a year filled with new life, change, and loss. It is an intimate joint portrait revealed through photographic snippets&amp;mdash;mending a sweater, making a mobile from a cherished collection, creating fabric dyes from natural materials, baking scones&amp;mdash;that defies distance through the celebration of shared moments of calmness, warmth, and family.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Both aspirational and down-to-earth, &lt;I&gt;A Year Between Friends&lt;/I&gt; is an inspiring visual love letter to friendship and creativity, a timeless reminder to appreciate life one day at a time, to slow down, to cherish simplicity, and to make the extra effort to do things with care and with the people we love.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

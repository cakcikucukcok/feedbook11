  <title>Purging Purgatory: A Ghost Story - Roger Mendoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do ghosts exist? To eight-year-old Tommy, they do. He can talk with ghosts. That&amp;rsquo;s one of his super-powers. Not only that, he can look at anyone, living or dead and see if there is any darkness around them. He can even talk to the darkness. It&amp;rsquo;s afraid of him. His grandmother warns him that a he cannot discern the good ghosts from the bad ones. His friend, Thomas disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is Purgatory for real? To Dorothy, Tommy&amp;rsquo;s grandmother it definitely is. Thrones of spirits fill her bedroom each night to hear her say prayers for them. A judgmental woman, she believes that she can see the evil in others. Tommy does not see darkness in those she sees as evil. He does see darkness in the priest that Dorothy adores.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to grow up in a family where it is normal to see ghosts and choose not to? For Catherine, Tommy&amp;rsquo;s mother, it is. She wants nothing to do with ghosts. Tommy doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand why. He worries that his mother doesn&amp;rsquo;t really believe in him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Will Dorothy learn to see what true evil is, even as she drinks a cup of coffee with him? Will Catherine learn that fighting against something you don&amp;rsquo;t want only brings it back with a vengeance? If Tommy survives to the end, will he learn that his natural gifts were always within his grasp? Or will the darkness snuff out his brilliant light and his amazing gifts? Is Tommy really a super-hero?&lt;/p&gt;" />

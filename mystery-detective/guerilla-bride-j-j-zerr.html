  <title>Guerilla Bride - J. J. Zerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1860, and Emerson Sharp has grown from a boy into a handsome man. Ever since he can remember, his father has governed every aspect of his life. When his father proclaims he will wed a neighbors plain daughter, Emerson rebels, has a fling with a local girl, and flees his Indiana farm to escape her angry brothers. When the brothers finally catch him, Emerson barely survives the deadly encounter.
As he is led down a new path, Emerson partners with notorious gambler Weakes Daley. After their travels land them in the middle of the Civil War, Weakes is killed in a poker game shoot-out, leading Emerson to befriend a Quantrill guerilla fighter and participate in a stagecoach holdup that eventually makes him a wanted man. After he changes his name to Tom Thackery, Emerson meets a woman he hopes will change everything for the better. But as the end of 1863 approaches, Emerson is brought full circle to a time when he had nothing but a gun, a horse, and a dream to head west. Now he must determine if salvation lies in that direction again.
Guerilla Bride shares the tale of a young mans journey from an Indiana farm into the midst of the Civil War where it seems everyone is intent on killing him." />

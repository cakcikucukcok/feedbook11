These are their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forbidden Love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is with a heavy heart that Reeve Garrett returns to Pride County. His half-brother had joined the southern cause and died a hero, while Reeve fought for the north&amp;#8212;earning the contempt of his town, his family. . .and his brother&#39;s fiancee, Patrice Sinclair. She is the only woman he had ever loved, but as the illegitimate son of a wealthy horse breeder, Reeve was unable to court her. And now that he&#39;s been branded a traitor, he fears she can never be his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrice Sinclair was the belle of Pride County&amp;#8212;with dreams of a lovely home, children, and a good man by her side. But her dreams have been destroyed and now the only man she can turn to for help is an outcast among his people. As she witnesses Reeve&#39;s struggle to rebuild their war-scarred down, she risks what little she has left to stand by his side.&lt;/p&gt;" />

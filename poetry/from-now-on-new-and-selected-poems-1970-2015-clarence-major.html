  <title>From Now On: New and Selected Poems, 1970-2015 - Clarence Major</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Clarence Major is a consummate artist whose work in poetry, fiction, and painting has been widely recognized. He has been part of twenty-eight group exhibitions, has had fifteen one-man shows, and has published fourteen collections of poetry and nine works of fiction. Major&amp;#8217;s works&amp;#8212;and this collection in particular&amp;#8212;are distinguished by his poetic sociability and his unblinking but generous and affectionate portraiture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;From Now On&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, a retrospective of poems from the 1950s to the present&amp;#8212;including selections from each of Major&amp;#8217;s previous books of poetry as well as a generous selection of new poems&amp;#8212;Major creates a vivid gallery of nimbly drawn characters. Here he establishes a voice that is singular and musical, one that draws witty, moving, and empathetic portraits of African American urban and country dwellers. Ultimately, this collection maintains Major&amp;#8217;s intimate, conversational poetry while simultaneously becoming more eclectic, multicultural, and cosmopolitan. Major&amp;#8217;s poetry is affable, but it suggests an insistence that we can connect with history and social change through the dynamic lives of the people we encounter daily.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />

  <title>Dead Heading - Catherine Aird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jack Haines reports a break-in at his greenhouse, the motive of the intruder is unclear. Other than the destruction of some expensive orchids, no damage has been done, and nothing seems to be missing. But Detectives Sloan and Crosby sense something sinister, and soon their suspicions are confirmed. Similar reports are multiplying and sabotage is the word on everyone&#39;s lips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair is drawn into an equally perplexing case when the mysterious Miss Enid Maude Osgathorp goes missing. Investigations begin at her deserted abode, Canonry Cottage, where the detectives soon discover that the house has been ransacked. Shattered glass is found in the larder, and traces of blood spatter are found on the floors. Something disturbing has undoubtedly taken place, but Sloan and Crosby can&#39;t figure out who did it, or why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it becomes clear that the two cases are linked, the two detectives must work to find the missing woman, and how she connects to the greenhouse burglary, before it is too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dead Heading &lt;/i&gt;is the 23rd book in Catherine Aird&#39;s series following Detective Chief Inspector C.D. Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>JEBPS Vol 13-N1 - Journal of Evidence-Based Practices for Schools</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Journal of Evidence-Based Practices for Schools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a leader in publishing research-to-practice articles for educators and school psychologists. The mission of this journal is to positively influence the daily practice of school-based professionals through studies demonstrating successful research-based practices in educational settings. As a result, the editors are committed to publishing articles with an eye toward improving student performance and outcomes by advancing psychological and educational practices in the schools. They seek articles using non-technical language that (1) outline an evidence-based practice, (2) describe the literature supporting the effectiveness and theoretical underpinnings of the practice, (3) describe the findings of a study in which the practice was implemented in an educational setting, and (4) provide readers with information they need to implement the practice in their own schools in a section entitled Implementation Guidelines. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Journal of Evidence-Based Practices for Schools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; differs from other scholarly journals in that it features articles that demonstrate empirically-based procedures for readers to apply the practice in their setting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

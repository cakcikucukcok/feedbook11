  <title>Empirical Futures - George Baca, Aisha Khan, Stephan Palmié</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the 1950s, anthropologist Sidney W. Mintz has been at the forefront of efforts to integrate the disciplines of anthropology and history. Author of &lt;i&gt;Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History&lt;/i&gt; and other groundbreaking works, he was one of the first scholars to anticipate and critique &quot;globalization studies.&quot; However, a strong tradition of epistemologically sophisticated and theoretically informed empiricism of the sort advanced by Mintz has yet to become a cornerstone of contemporary anthropological scholarship. This collection of essays by leading anthropologists and historians serves as an intervention that rests on Mintz&#39;s rigorously historicist ethnographic work, which has long predicted the methodological crisis in anthropology today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contributors to this volume build on Mintzean interdisciplinarity to provide productive ways to theorize the everyday life of local groups and communities, nation-states, and regions and the interconnections among them. Consisting of theoretical and case studies of Latin America, North America, the Caribbean, and Papua New Guinea, &lt;i&gt;Empirical Futures&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates how Mintzean perspectives advance our understanding of the relationship among empirical approaches, the uses of ethnographic and historical data and theory-building, and the study of these from both local and global vantage points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contributors:&lt;br/&gt;George Baca, Goucher College&lt;br/&gt;Frederick Cooper, New York University&lt;br/&gt;Virginia R.

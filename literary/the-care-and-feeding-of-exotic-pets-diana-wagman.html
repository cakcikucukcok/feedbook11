  <title>The Care and Feeding of Exotic Pets - Diana  Wagman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Winnie Parker, mother to an angst-ridden teenage daughter and ex-wife to a successful game show host who left her for a twenty-something contestant, begins a normal day in her hum-drum existence by dropping her car off at the repair shop. After accepting what she believes is a ride to pick up her rental car, Winnie realizes too late that she&#39;s been kidnapped.What follows is a riveting psychological game of cat and mouse set in the kidnapper&#39;s tropically heated house&amp;#151;kept that way for Cookie, a menacing seven-foot long Iguana headquartered in the kitchen. While desperately seeking to escape&amp;#151;which leads to several violent clashes with her increasingly unstable kidnapper&amp;#151;Winnie also tries to understand why she was taken captive. Is her kidnapper merely seeking a ransom or does he have something more sinister in mind? Does he know that Winnie&#39;s mother is an Oscar-winning actress? Or did he connect her with Jonathan, her famous ex-husband? When the truth reveals itself, Winnie is not only forced to fight for her life, but must also protect the lives of those she loves from the kidnapper&#39;s deranged master plan.An engrossing, darkly humorous, edge-of-your-seat story, &lt;I&gt;The Care and Feeding of Exotic Pets&lt;/I&gt; explores the dynamic between kidnapper and kidnapped, bizarre reptile lore, and the absurdity of the celebrity lifestyle.&lt;B&gt;Diana Wagman&lt;/B&gt; is the author of the novels &lt;I&gt;Bump&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Spontaneous&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#151;which won the PEN Center USA Award for Fiction&amp;#151;and &lt;I&gt;Skin Deep&lt;/I&gt;.

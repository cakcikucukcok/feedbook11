  <title>Walk on Water - Linda Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="i have been writing poetry since I was in high school.
In college at Sacred Heart in Houston, Texas I majored in English Literature.
Later I took writing courses through the mail.
I have also studied many poets, my favorite being Emily Dickinson.
I belonged to Back To Word a poetry group that met at the Arts Alliance in Clear Lake, Tx. for four years.  
I continue to work on my poetry and try to write at least two poems a week.
I have always enjoyed writing, especially poetry which helps me express my feelings better than I am able to in speaking.
I also enjoy sharing my poems with my friends.
I enjoy playing with words and creating something that didn&#39;t exist before.
I live in a rather remote area called Texas City, Tx which is between Houston and Galveston.
I was born in Galveston, Tx or On The Island as people from here like to say.
I am a mother of two grown children, Jennifer and Jon and have a granddaughter, Makyla.
I write on many different subjects and enjoy sharing my poetry with family and friends.
Many of my poems have been written about some of my friends and family.  I feel the people in my life have greatly contributed to my poetry.
I also believe that writing is a gift given to me by God and I want to share it with the world." />

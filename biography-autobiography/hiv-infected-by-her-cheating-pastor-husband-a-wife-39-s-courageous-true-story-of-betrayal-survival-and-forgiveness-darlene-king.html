  <title>HIV Infected by Her Cheating Pastor Husband: A Wife&#39;s Courageous True Story of Betrayal, Survival and Forgiveness - Darlene King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this autobiography, Evangelist Darlene King relives her life giving an intimate perspective of her mistakes and life lessons as she lays everything on the line.  Travel on a journey in her shoes as she recalls her struggles of being infected with HIV by her husband--a church pastor--and still constantly having to fight for her marriage through her husband&#39;s on-going adultery.  She learns the hard way that if HIV doesn&#39;t stop him from cheating, nothing will. &lt;br&gt;Darlene suffered from verbal abuse by her cheating pastor husband who aimed to break her spirit with insults such as, &quot;I married beneath me,&quot; to dealing with the pain of lies and deceit that come with drug addiction.  This is an eye opening story of one woman&#39;s triumph over divorce, depression, disease, and distress. Darlene invites you to join in her emotional roller coaster that will make you laugh, cry, feel happy, sad, joyful, loving and inspired. This book is full of stories that will leave you saying, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that,&quot; and &quot;NO, he didn&#39;t do that!&quot;  This book is definitely an eye opener for women who don&#39;t believe the worst can happen with a man cloaked in holy clothing. &lt;br&gt;King is a devoted mother, preacher, and volunteer speaker for Action Aids of Philadelphia.  She is so thankful that God has allowed her to live to see and experience exceedingly, abundantly more than she could have imagined since she tested positive for HIV in 1991. Her hope is that this book changes how we look at those people infected with HIV and that it may prompt a dialogue for people to be educated and get tested. She is now ready to share her story with the world. As she pours her pain onto the pages of this book, she hopes to speak out for anyone who has been scared into silence or afraid of how they will be treated when their health news is revealed.  She hopes to provide inspiration to all... especially those whom society has deemed unworthy. &lt;br&gt;This book inspires the movement to love others as we want to be loved.  Readers will realize that today it&#39;s not just the drug addict being infected with HIV, but it&#39;s also the preacher&#39;s wife and the senior citizen.  May this book prompt the thought, but for the grace of God, it could be my mother, father, sister, brother--or it could be me." />

  <title>A Bride For The Holidays (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Renee Roszel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Trisha August is determined to be independent and will do anything–well, almost anything–for enough money to set up her own business. She can&#39;t believe her luck when hotshot Lassiter Dragan promises to give her a loan….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s a catch–she has to become his temporary &quot;wife&quot; for the Christmas holidays!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lassiter has sworn that he&#39;ll never make himself vulnerable through love. So a convenient, temporary wife seems the perfect solution to enhance his business image. Only, living as man and wife is harder than either of them expects. Lassiter is appalled to discover he&#39;s falling in love with his wife!&lt;/p&gt;

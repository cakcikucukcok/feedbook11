  <title>Bone Appétit - Carolyn Haines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the midst of a cook-off at a posh spa, southern PI Sarah Booth Delaney gets embroiled in a juicy murder in the latest mystery from Carolyn Haines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years Jitty, Dahlia House&#39;s resident ghost, has dreamed that Sarah Booth Delaney would have a child to inherit the family&#39;s ancestral home. Sarah Booth has always had reservations about being a parent. There was her work as an actress and PI, taking care of the house, not to mention finding the right man. But when Jitty&#39;s dream finally looks like it&#39;s going to come true, Sarah Booth is crushed when it doesn&#39;t. Depressed, unable to act or investigate, Sarah Booth finally allows her best friend to whisk her away for a luxurious weekend vacation at a special spa and cooking school. &lt;br&gt;The pampering and food go a long way toward making her feel like her old self, but there&#39;s another welcome distraction--there&#39;s a beauty contest/cook-off going on to find the spa&#39;s next spokesperson, and watching the drama really takes her mind off of her woes. Sarah finds the backbiting to be great fun--until the heated competition boils over, the top contender is poisoned, and the prime suspect hires Sarah Booth to clear her name. &lt;br&gt;Between swimsuit competitions and soufflés, Sarah Booth Delaney and her best friend and partner, Tinkie, must find out which of the ambitious young ladies is to blame in &lt;i&gt;Bone Appetit&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in Carolyn Haines&#39;s delightfully Southern cozy mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;" />

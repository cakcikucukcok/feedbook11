  <title>King of the Badgers - Philip Hensher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; Notable Fiction Book for 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Fiction Books 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from London&#39;s crime and pollution, Hanmouth&#39;s wealthier residents live in picturesque, heavily mortgaged cottages in the center of a town packed with artisanal cheese shops and antiques stores. They&#39;re reminded of the town&#39;s less desirable outskirts--with their grim, flimsy housing stock and chain stores--only when their neighbors have the presumption to claim also to live in Hanmouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an eight-year-old girl from the outer area goes missing, England&#39;s eyes suddenly turn toward the sleepy town with a curiosity as piercing and unblinking as the closed-circuit security cameras that line Hanmouth&#39;s idyllic streets. But somehow these cameras have missed the abduction of the girl, whose name is China. Is her blank-eyed hairdresser mother hiding her as part of a moneymaking hoax? Has she been abducted by one of the lurking perverts the townspeople imagine the cameras are protecting them from? Perhaps more cameras are needed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, more than one resident of Hanmouth has a secret hidden behind closed doors. There&#39;s Sam and Harry, the cheesemonger and aristocrat who lead the county&#39;s gay orgies. The quiet husband of postcolonial theorist Miranda (everyone agrees she&#39;s marvelous) keeps a male lover, while their daughter disembowels dolls she&#39;s named Child Pornography and Slightly Jewish. Moral crusader John Calvin&#39;s Neighborhood Watch has an unusual reason for holding its meetings in secret. And, of course, somewhere out there is the house where little China is hidden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the dark hilarity and unflinching honesty of a modern-day &lt;i&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;King of the Badgers &lt;/i&gt;demolishes the already fragile privacy of Hanmouth&#39;s inhabitants. These characters, exquisitely drawn and rawly human, proclaim Philip Hensher&#39;s status as an extraordinary chronicler of the domestic, and one of the world&#39;s most dazzling and ambitious novelists.&lt;/p&gt;" />

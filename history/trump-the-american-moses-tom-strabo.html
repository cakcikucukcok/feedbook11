      <meta name="description" content="Our nation is being held in bondage by the liberal, politically correct establishment. We need to get our country back from &quot;Pharaoh&quot; (the Washington D.C. elite). We need an American Moses who will tell the crony priesthood of talentless moochers and looters, &quot;Let my people go!&quot; Is Donald Trump the prophet for our time, the leader who can bring America out of its exile in the Wilderness and lead it back to the Promised Land? America was great once, and it can be again ... provided we get rid of the weak, pathetic liberals who wreck everything they touch. Liberals are the cause of the Decline and Fall of America. They are the last people to recognize that their craven weakness in the face of anti-American forces and cultures has led to the complete erosion of the traditional American way of life, which was the basis of American exceptionalism. The liberals have ceaselessly sinned against our manifest destiny. They are the problem, and we are the answer. They are the defect, and we are the correction." />

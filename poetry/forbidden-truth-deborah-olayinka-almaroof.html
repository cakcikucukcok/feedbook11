  <title>Forbidden Truth - Deborah Olayinka Almaroof</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever heard a song or read a poem and thought, I wonder what made the artist sing/write these words? Whats the story behind that song? What does the message actually mean? What memory is the artist reflecting on? Maybe you read a metaphoric poem written by a legendary poet and wondered what it really meant. Not the interpretations made by many over the years. With Forbidden Truth, poet and author Deborah Almaroof gives you her complete vision. She allows you to embark on the mental capacity at the time of each works creation and gives insight into what each poem means. 
Deborah Almaroof began writing at a young age, love songs and short stories. At the age of 20, as a sophomore at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, five hours away from her hometown; she found herself alone and unhappy being so far away from her family. She searched for a coping mechanism and one night began to write. It was then that she tapped into a gift she never knew she had; the ability to construct poetry. To her surprise what she initially thought nothing of turned into endless nights up, turning her deepest thoughts into amazing art. At the age of 21, she vowed that at the age of 25 she would release her first poetry book. Here she gives you a collection of her poems and personal quotes, teamed up with her life experiences that inspired them.  
It has been said that the richest place on earth is a graveyard. Many are buried with unshared riches, gifts, ideas and talents. With this project the author proclaims that no measurement of success comes from the external; critique nor praise compares to the magnitude of success inside these pages. To achieve this goal, first time author and poet Deborah Almaroof says this is her success. Reaching a goal in a world where many people never witness their biggest dreams transform into a reality. Forbidden Truth is truly one to sink your teeth into!" />

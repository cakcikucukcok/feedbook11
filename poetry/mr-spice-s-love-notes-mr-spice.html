  <title>Mr. Spice’S Love Notes - Mr. Spice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book are long overdue remnants of what lovers would say. With passion and concern, these poems express my sentiments. What I wish I had enough time to say to my special lady is presented here in a limited way. My heart felt moments didnt have chance to join the emotions desired to share. 
Thus, still kindling passion found homage to women in form of writing. Boredom was hoped to be replaced with literature of interest. Humor and affectation, mixed with fantasy was combined for purer pleasure. Every poem is intended to stir curiosity and pacify intimate cravings. Henceforth these love poems were meant to soothe, arouse passion and entertain. 
What men could, should and would say is for women on the verge of love. Since women often cant wait, they need not to hear what they want. Some poems are personal, and others women may find too provocative. All in all, love is what women want, and love is what I intend to give. I wish all women the best in receiving true love. These writings are prelude to loving mannerisms Id give if able. Love has many forms, I choose these poems. In essence, time gives you a chance; this book will give some romance.
These words specifically, for the pleasure of women, have many purposes. For reason, for arousal from depression, focus is to evoke absolute thrill. Daily pleasures are not often obtained; therefore, these writings will keep a woman entertained.
Women have assisted men to establish and be their prime interest. When men couldnt find men to help accomplish, women filled in. When other pleasures did not satisfy, a woman always could. This book is an appeal to women who serve in support of all mens desires. So accommodation is intended to comfort women in
an intimate mood. Too often, females are lonely, going years to find someone concerned. Females dont always have someone to talk to them lovingly. They need someone to learn about and understand them sentimentally. Each female needs a specialist to sensually excite moments that are bland. So this literature provides a personal form of passion. Attention need not be on grief, neglect, abuse or suffering. Boredom and pitying ones self has been escaped, reading about affections. Too many times, people dont have time to console a special someone. In short, words of this book are meant to arouse as solace, to love action-eluded females.
This book is a temporary substitute for a womans dream man. It represents the bouquet of flowers a man intends to give. It is a sample of what could be said in a fantasy that may soon be real. Thus, it is what women could and should be told by a lover on hold." />

  <title>The Fashion Insiders&amp;#39; Guide to Paris - Carole Sabas, Caroline Andrieu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;T&lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;he Fashion Insiders&amp;#8217; Guides&lt;/I&gt; are carefully curated compendiums of the current hotspots, classic haunts, and hidden gems of the world&amp;#8217;s greatest fashion destinations. A former Parisian living in New York, French &lt;I&gt;Vogue&lt;/I&gt; correspondent Carole Sabas was often approached by friends and colleagues on their way to Paris for Fashion Week, looking for the best place for a quick facial, early morning yoga, or to meet a friend for a drink. So many people asked, in fact, that she produced a small guide filled with advice, which she gave out for free. Requests for more information and other cities came pouring in.&lt;BR&gt;Abrams is now making Sabas&amp;#8217;s Paris and New York guides available to everyone, with expanded content including chapters such as &amp;#8220;Eating and Drinking,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Beauty,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Health,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Shopping,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Art,&amp;#8221; and an eclectic selection of odds and ends called &amp;#8220;Might Be Useful One Day.&amp;#8221; Written with a light touch and in a friendly tone, each entry includes a description of the recommended spots with hints about when to go, who to ask for, and what to get, as well as location and contact information. The inclusion of additional advice from local fashion celebrities on their favorite places to frequent puts readers confidently in-the-know. Peppered throughout with drawings by a noted and local fashion illustrator, these beautifully designed guides will be the must-have accessories of the season." />

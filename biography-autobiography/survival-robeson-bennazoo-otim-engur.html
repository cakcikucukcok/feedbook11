      <meta name="description" content="Survival is the frank and the opinionated story of a man behind this struggle in life. Famously humble about his experiences straight on all events that took place in his life thus giving us a unique view of life, tragedies and glory.
From humble beginnings in Uganda, Robeson has overcome the odds to become an accomplished scholar in his own right.
His determination for success and willingness to to confront hardships head-on has been the stepping stone to his arduous journey into the unknown  and unchartered territory.
Love him or hate him, he has proved in many fronts that, &#39;where there is a will, there is a way&#39;. He has proved that it is the experiences you have in life that makes you what you are., and not things that are given to you.
Every single event in his life was a difficult and that changed his character as a person profusely and these are circumstances we view in life as bad luck. During the difficult times, he found the strength to carry on - to move forward and make something good come out of a bad situation." />

  <title>Natural Expressions - Andrea J. Parham-Shannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Natural Expressions &quot;A Family Affair&quot; truly reflect &quot;Gods&quot; favor on me. &quot;Gods&quot; hand is a hand of power and &quot;He&quot; has continued to keep me in &quot;His&quot; hands as I go forth in &quot;His&quot; name with Natural Expressions. Since Natural Expressions &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot;, many changes in my life have come but, through Christ Jesus and His Angels &quot;Grace and Mercy&quot;, I&#39;ve been able to endure the challenges. As the elders would say &quot;what don&#39;t kill us only makes us stronger&quot; and boy ain&#39;t that the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;A Family Affair&quot; is dedicated in memory of my husband Rudolph who passed away in September 2010. The memory of him enjoying my poetry will always be an inspiration. My favorite book of romance is the Bible&#39;s Old Testaments &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;. God&#39;s love is powerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;Look at God&quot;. Another collection, another blessing. Oh, I look to the hills and I defi nitely recognize where and whom my help comes from. Since Natural Expressions &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot; I&#39;ve relocated to the hometown of my family in Warrenton, North Carolina, a drastic change from Washington, DC but, I welcome the change and the folks are wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;A Family Affair&quot; was inspired by everyday living, family, friends, church and romance. A chance fi nally to share my children&#39;s (April and Vernon) school days poetry. How surprised I was to fi nd a suitcase tucked away that contained much of my children&#39;s school work, pictures, and report cards and yes, poetry written by them. What an honor to share their expressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, &quot;To God be the glory&quot;. I pray that you have found one if not many poems in this collection to uplift and encourage you along your journey. If so, than our writings are not in vain. Peace and Blessings, Andrea J. Parham-Shannon&lt;/p&gt;" />

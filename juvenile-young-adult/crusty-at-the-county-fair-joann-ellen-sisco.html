  <title>Crusty at the County Fair - Joann Ellen Sisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The small armor-plated animal had his own reasons for doing what he did.  Food came first, and it didnt matter much what it was, just as long as there was enough of it.
   Who would have known that he would accidentally taste a certain food that changed his whole life?  He was not great on figuring things out, but somehow he managed to link that taste with a human and a feline.  His next concern was to avoid letting the girl and the cat get away.
   This book is the introduction to the Twenty Book Series, Wildwood Village Summer Camp where 25 girls, ages ten to twelve, could spend a summer with each other and the local animals of central Oklahoma." />

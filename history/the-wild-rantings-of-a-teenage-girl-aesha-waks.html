  <title>The Wild Rantings of a Teenage Girl - Aesha Waks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aeshas first passion on this planet has been poetry. Ever since she was a little girl, she has been picking up awards for her writing, leaving trails of moonbeams, stardust, and truth everywhere she roams. She picked up first place at the Junior Fire Chief Poetry Awards at age six, Creative Writing Award at Mark Twain Junior High School, first place in Kingsborough Community Colleges Silver Award, and her poem The Midnight Hour was featured in the Angelina Jolieproduced film Lovesick. 
Aeshas poetry is mostly inspired by romance and named after friendships and affairs with rock stars and celebrities she has met along the way. After nights on open mic at the renowned Knitting Factory, Aesha went on to become a professional hip-hop recording and live artist. Aside from being an award-winning actress, she is also the author of The Model Body Plan (AeshaWorld.com). Here is a look into her young teenage mind and where she sprung and was created from.
This book is composed of a teenagers written poems, short stories, songs, and raps, including postteen pieces to show progression throughout the years. Some works are fact, while some are fiction. Aesha will leave it to you to decide the truth.

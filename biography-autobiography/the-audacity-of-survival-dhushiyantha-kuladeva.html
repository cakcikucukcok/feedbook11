  <title>The Audacity of Survival - Dhushiyantha Kuladeva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do people who have been diagnosed with terminal cancer do differently, to live a meaningful life? What do people do, when they have been told that they are living on borrowed time? What does it mean to break down all self-imposed barriers, to achieve a sense of personal freedom, while making sense of everything that does not seem to fit the puzzle of life?
Dhushiyantha Kuladeva, (Dhush, as he is known within his inner circle), answers these questions in his first book titled The Audacity of Survival, and describes the experience as an opulent one. He synthesizes his personal experience in dealing with full blown cancer, and transfers an initially perturbed mindset into a positive one. He creates a personal blue print of learning, to discover endless possibilities from the vast labyrinth of experience, rolling up his sleeves, fighting tenaciously, and cherishing the golden empirical lessons from actually getting things done.
The journey transcends over two decades and states very clearly that living life against all odds was never tantamount to a death sentence and sets out to live his life with extraordinary audacity, while recognizing that the journey could very well be the final chapter of his life. In an unusual marriage of ideals, Dhush talks about his opulent experience, while living with cancer, and took to the sheer brilliance of palette and fleece in the magnificent area of Persian and Oriental Rugs, and merges the relationship as a means of healing.
This remarkable journey unfolds, as he begins to make sense of the existential infrastructure of life.... The audacity of survival  an opulent experience is a personal account that obscures an extraordinary journey and a relentless story of life worth living." />

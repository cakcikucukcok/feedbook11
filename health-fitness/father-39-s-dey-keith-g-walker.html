  <title>Father&#39;s Dey - Keith G. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Book on Fatherhood Revealing the Consequences of Fatherless Homes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Statistics, provided by US D.H.H.S., Bureau of Census, show that 85% of all youths sitting in prisons, 63% of youth suicides, 90% of all homeless and runaway children; and 85% of all children that exhibit behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes. These are only few of the depressing truths and information caused by this situation. Author Keith G. Walker shares his own personal struggles from living a life without a father  to trying to save his sons from a similar fate. In his engrossing book, Fathers Dey, readers will discover how he lived such a complicated life at such a young age and how he made it through.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Why do these things occur and how could these issues be addressed? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I feel there is a great disparity when it comes to fathers gaining custody of their children and want to bring this problem to the attention of the public so that changes can be made, giving fathers an even playing field, Walker says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Father&#39;s Dey, readers will follow the story of a young man who grew up without his parents, lived with several different relatives, and despite the low odds of surviving, he goes on to do great things and become very successful and a good example to others in similar situations. Walker has written two fictitious chapters which show what has happened with others and what can happen  depicting situations and outcomes where no one wins. This book is an eye-opening instrument that would enlighten readers about the value of family, the essence of parental love, and the importance of parental guidance and presence in their childrens growing up years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Filled with real life events common to many families throughout the world, suffused with intense emotions, and dashed with indispensable insights on fatherhood and family rearing, Fathers Dey is an interesting and inspirational read everyone will find fascinating and revealing." />

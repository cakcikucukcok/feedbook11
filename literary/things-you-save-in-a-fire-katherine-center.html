As one of the only female firefighters in her Texas firehouse, she&#39;s seen her fair share of them, and she&#39;s a total pro at other people&#39;s tragedies. But when her estranged and ailing mother asks her to give up her whole life and move to Boston, Cassie suddenly has an emergency of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tough, old-school Boston firehouse is as different from Cassie&#39;s old job as it could possibly be. Hazing, a lack of funding, and poor facilities mean that the firemen aren&#39;t exactly thrilled to have a &quot;lady&quot; on the crew--even one as competent and smart as Cassie. Except for the infatuation-inspiring rookie, who doesn&#39;t seem to mind having Cassie around. But she can&#39;t think about that. Because love is girly, and it&#39;s not her thing. And don&#39;t forget the advice her old captain gave her: &lt;i&gt;Never date firefighters. &lt;/i&gt;Cassie can feel her resolve slipping...and it means risking it all--the only job she&#39;s ever loved, and the hero she&#39;s worked like hell to become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katherine Center&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Things You Save in a Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a heartfelt and healing tour-de-force about the strength of vulnerability, the nourishing magic of forgiveness, and the life-changing power of defining courage, at last, for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

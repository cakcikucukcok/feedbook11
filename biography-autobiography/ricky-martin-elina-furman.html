  <title>Ricky Martin - Elina Furman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Smart, sexy, and soulful, Ricky Martin is more than a pop star.  He&#39;s an accomplished actor and Grammy-award-winning singer who takes himself and his music seriously.  Immensely talented, he started out young, acting in commercials at the age of six, and eventually joined the hugely successful singing group Menudo.  In 1994 he joined the cast of the highly rated soap opera &lt;i&gt;General Hospital&lt;/i&gt; and later landed the lead role in the smash Broadway musical &lt;i&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/i&gt;, two career moves which would launch him into world-wide superstardom.  From there, Ricky wanted to return to his first love, singing--and he did it with a bang, creating two multi-platinum solo albums, which won him a Grammy for Best Latin Pop Performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s next for this gifted heartthrob?  With show-stopping good looks, talent to spare, and ambition to burn, the sky seems to be the limit.  Find out about the man behind the image...discover what this cute crooner has said about his success, love, and music...learn about the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Ricky Martin--you&#39;ll be glad you did!&lt;/p&gt;" />

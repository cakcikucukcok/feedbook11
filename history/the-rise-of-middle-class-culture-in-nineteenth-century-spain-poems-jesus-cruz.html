  <title>The Rise of Middle-Class Culture in Nineteenth-Century Spain: Poems - Jesus Cruz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his stimulating study, Jesus Cruz examines middle-class lifestyles -- generally known as bourgeois culture -- in nineteenth-century Spain. Cruz argues that the middle class ultimately contributed to Spain&#39;s democratic stability and economic prosperity in the last decades of the twentieth century.&lt;br&gt;Interdisciplinary in scope, Cruz&#39;s work draws upon the methodology of various areas of study -- including material culture, consumer studies, and social history -- to investigate class. In recent years, scholars in the field of Spanish studies have analyzed disparate elements of modern middle-class milieu, such as leisure and sociability, but Cruz looks at these elements as part of the whole. He traces the contribution of nineteenth-century bourgeois cultures not only to Spanish modernity but to the history of Western modernity more broadly. &lt;br&gt;The Rise of Middle-Class Culture in Nineteenth-Century Spain provides key insights for scholars in the fields of Spanish and European studies, including history, literary studies, art history, historical sociology, and political science.&lt;/p&gt;" />

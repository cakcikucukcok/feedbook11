  <title>The Ten Spring Woods - Fred K. Tarrant Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Reader.  The Ten Spring Woods is in fact a real place, located within the City of Saratoga Springs N.Y.  It was with unspeakable pleasure that the author, with his friends, played in that beautiful woodland as a young child nearly eighty years ago.  Today, the Ten Spring Woods is but a shadow of its former self, due to the relentless pressures of home building and other human activities.  Today it might be difficult to find those ten pure bubbling springs.  However, fortunately, a small 15 acre tract of the Woods has been set aside for protection and conservation today.  
A legend engraved in 1793 on a water pitcher, belonging to the authors family, says it all:
Come to the living waters, come.  Sinners obey your makers call.  Oh, come ye weary wanderers home, and find his grace is free for all." />

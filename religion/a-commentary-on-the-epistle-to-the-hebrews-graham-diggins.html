  <title>A Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews. - Graham Diggins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A statement of the books aims: 
	To return Christians to biblical norms. To get them thinking about the old paths and what was considered the whole truth. 
	To encourage Christians to pursue Bible study by giving them helps such as an understanding of some basic NT Greek.
	 To set forth the wonder of the Lord Jesus Christ as revealed to us as our High Priest and Saviour. 
Its special merits:
	 Verse-by-verse and, often, word-by-word comments on a book of the Bible that usually receives little, if any, church, Bible study, and preaching attention. It looks closely at the Greek words used (of the eclectic [WH] variety and the TR). 
	 It examines in detail many of the fundamentals of the Christian faith and challenges doctrines and actions held by some professing Christians today. 
	It reproduces many non-Hebrews scriptures that are quoted so that readers do not have to look them up (this is a time-saver). 
	 It has many additional questions at the end of a section to aid, stimulate, and guide the minds of Christians in their pursuit of the truth. 
	It includes the names and dates of many historical figures from theology, hymnology, philosophy, and science. 
	It has a set of appendices at the back on various topics. They are mainly from the Hebrews commentary so one does not have to search through the book for them." />

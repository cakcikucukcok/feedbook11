      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Amazon Best Nonfiction Book of the Month&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indiebound Bestseller &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Award-winning science writer Helen Thomson unlocks the biggest mysteries of the human brain by examining nine extraordinary cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains are far stranger than we think. We take it for granted that we can remember, feel emotion, navigate, empathise and understand the world around us, but how would our lives change if these abilities were dramatically enhanced &amp;#8211; or disappeared overnight? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen Thomson has spent years travelling the world, tracking down incredibly rare brain disorders. In &lt;em&gt;Unthinkable&lt;/em&gt; she tells the stories of nine extraordinary people she encountered along the way. From the man who thinks he&#39;s a tiger to the doctor who feels the pain of others just by looking at them to a woman who hears music that&amp;#8217;s not there, their experiences illustrate how the brain can shape our lives in unexpected and, in some cases, brilliant and alarming ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Story by remarkable story, &lt;em&gt;Unthinkable&lt;/em&gt; takes us on an unforgettable journey through the human brain. Discover how to forge memories that never disappear, how to grow an alien limb and how to make better decisions. Learn how to hallucinate and how to make yourself happier in a split second. Find out how to avoid getting lost, how to see more of your reality, even how exactly you can confirm you are alive. Think the unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Mistress Sarah&#39;s Domain - Ross Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
James wants a threeway with his wife, Sarah and her best friend, Jackie. Sara will oblige him, but not before some new rules are agreed to. Rules that will test their commitment to one another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
When James heard the key hit the lock on the door, his cock started straining against the wires surrounding it, making it tight and uncomfortable but also strangely arousing and he struggled to keep himself in check. He heard the unmistakable sound of his front door open then slam shut. The next sounds he heard was Sarah&amp;rsquo;s heels clicking against the hardwood floors and her voice next to his ear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, well, well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see my pet knows how to follow directions. Dishes done. Floor sparkling. And all dressed up in his new outfit. But what&amp;rsquo;s this? Is my pet&amp;rsquo;s little friend trying to get out of his new home already? Well, he&amp;rsquo;d better suck it up. Because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a long weekend cooped up in there. Unless my pet wants to back out of the deal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, ma&amp;rsquo;am.&amp;rdquo; James replied with a quivering voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Very well,&amp;rdquo; Sarah said, not more than two inches from his face. &amp;ldquo;Shall we begin?&amp;rdquo;" />

  <title>Youth on the Move - Davinia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Youth on the move is based on personal life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As youth we face many difficult situations and there are times when we feel alone. This book is to let young people know, they are not alone, that there are solutions to their circumstances and problems. Never give up, feel hopeless and alone. Born to a family of two, me being the only girl and the youngest. My parents divorced when I was nine years old, hence my determination to write about the challenges and victories, defeats and triumphs I faced growing up in a broken home. I matriculated in 2003, studied travel and tourism, tried my hand at modeling. I am currently employed in Local Goverment. Despite my setbacks due to financial restraints, my belief that someday this book would be published has become a reality. My faith and trust in God has allowed me to attain my success in life and with the understanding that my altitude determines my attitude has helped me to overcome the obstacles I have faced, My passion for hurting and broken people has driven me to write this book and I believe this book will bring hope and restoration for those who find themselves facing the harsh challenges of this journey we call life. We were all created for a purpose and that purpose unfolds when you discover it from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART YOU CAN DO IT, YOU WILL ACHIEVE IT!!!&lt;/p&gt;" />

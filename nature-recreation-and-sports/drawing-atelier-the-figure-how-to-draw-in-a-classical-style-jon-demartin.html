  <title>Drawing Atelier - The Figure: How to Draw in a Classical Style - Jon deMartin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most challenging of subjects for the artist, the human figure also offers opportunities for works of incredible beauty and complexity. In this book, one of today&amp;#39;s leading figurative artists shares techniques and approaches for drawing the human form. With a reverent grounding in the methods of the Old Masters and keen perspective developed over Jon DeMartin&amp;#39;s 20+ years of making and teaching art, this comprehensive workshop focuses on the power of line and how it can be used to achieve a convincing sense of dimension and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully illustrated with classical drawings as well as step-by-step progressions, these lessons explore the enlightening practice of copying, how to use proportion and measurement wisely, drawing the head and its features, rendering the figure in motion, short-pose exercises, and much, much more. Throughout, artists will master techniques for achieving a compelling &amp;quot;living force&amp;quot; in their drawings, while building a base of understanding that will ultimately make the process more intuitive and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

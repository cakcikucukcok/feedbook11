  <title>What Is My Mission - Hyacinth E. Anyanwu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the pre-mortal realm an investigation is made into the conditions of the human race on the earth, with specific emphasis on the needs of Africa. Upon reporting his results, Joseph volunteers and is called to a great work of redemption. After serious tests and preparation he is commissioned and ordained and sent in a spaceship to earth, to perform his mission.
Throughout his childhood, teenage years and beyond, the protagonist is searching for truth and the knowledge he pre-mortally held about his existence, purpose and mission on earth. The sorrows, grieves, pains and trials of life, the wars, sufferings, injustices and persecutions he experiences, form an important part of his spiritual and mental training. Through steady diligence and obedience to the laws of life, a man of integrity and virtue is formed. When the time is right, the knowledge is revealed and the real journey begins.
What is my Mission is not a fiction story or a novel, but a poetic autobiography and testimony that contains precious truths and insights about life and the purpose of existence. The sincere reader will be enlightened, strengthened and given pearls of wisdom to be able to navigate better through his or her life and towards greater peace and prosperity personally, in family life and in forming and influencing the communities and nations of the world.
Ultimately, we are all on our own individual quest to come to find the answer to the soul-searching question: What is my Mission?" />

  <title>The Borough of Licab - George F. Esguerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Borough of Licab&lt;/i&gt; shares the true stories of a Filipino citizen born in the Ilocos region of the Philippines and his reflections on how the people of this remarkable area were forever influenced by the power of foreign invaders.
It was not until Ferdinand Magellan led an expedition that unintentionally landed him on the Philippine island that it was finally recognized by the Europeanssetting off a multitude of occupations by the Spanish, Japanese, and Americans that forced the islands people into a perpetual struggle to gain freedom, dignity, and independence from the prejudiced intruders. With a narrative style, George Esguerra begins by sharing brief histories of Portugal and Spain and continues with in-depth studies of each foreign occupation, the eight radiances of the sun, the significant provinces, and the political leaders who, each in their own way, helped change the history of an island and its people who simply wanted to live as a free nation.
With vivid descriptions and colorful images, &lt;i&gt;The Borough of Licabi&lt;.i&gt; offers an exploration of an intriguing time in history when the people of the Ilocos region were unwillingly manipulated by greed and the power of a three-hundred-fifty-year-old oppression." />

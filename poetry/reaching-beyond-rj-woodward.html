  <title>Reaching Beyond - Rj Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was born in Swan River Manitoba and raised in Kamsack Saskatchewan. I left home at seventeen and spent twenty six years in the Canadian military. My life has taken me through such a series of diverse events that the desire to share the stories that touched my life became a life goal. I believe everyone has a story to share and from each story another can be told. We relate to life events from experiences related by others. This book has no real beginning or end it is a mere snapshot in time. I purposely wrote this book using no names so others could relate to stories within their own life. We all have had people that impacted our lives and at that time there stories have moved us. Once gone they are not forgotten but some of their unique stories are. Read, enjoy, share." />

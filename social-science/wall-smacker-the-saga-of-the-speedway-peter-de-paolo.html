  <title>Wall Smacker - The saga of the speedway - Peter De Paolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“ …The pages that follow are not offered as an attempt at literary style or excellence. I am far from being a writer, and, to tell the truth, “Wall Smacker” was the hardest task I’ve ever undertaken. It was my good fortune, however, to have had my career as an automobile racing driver during a glamorous and pioneering period of the sport era both in America and on the Continent that produced many immortals of the “Roaring Road,” and was packed with events and incidents of unusual interest to all followers of speed.
Many of my friends, realizing this, have urged me repeatedly to write my reminiscences in the form of an autobiography. Here, at last they are. I’ll feel fully repaid for my efforts if this book is entertaining, and happy, indeed, if it serves to keep alive at least a few of the episodes of a great chapter in the history of American automobile racing…”

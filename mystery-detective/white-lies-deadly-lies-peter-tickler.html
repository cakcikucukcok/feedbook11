  <title>White Lies, Deadly Lies - Peter Tickler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Doug Mullen rescues a mother and daughter from a multiple car-crash on the M40 near Oxford, a video taken by an onlooker briefly turns him into a reluctant hero. But public exposure via the Internet brings its own problems. There is no accounting for who will see you and what that may lead on to. Mullen is a private detective, house-sitter and reluctant dog-sitter. He is also a bit of a soft touch when he encounters damsels in distress. While trying to support the damaged Natalie Swan and her rebellious daughter Ellie, he finds himself a man in demand. A missing refugee, threatening letters and an unexpected death are just the beginning. As Mullen tries to meet the needs of all those asking for his help, he - and his westiepoodle Rex - swiftly finds himself sucked into a web of deceit and murder.  There are lies to be uncovered and the truth to be found, but sometimes it is hard to know which is better. This is the sixth of Peter Tickler&#39;s highly praised Oxford crime novels and the second featuring Doug Mullen (the first is Dead in the Water).  &#39;He has a wonderful gift of creating geographically factual settings for his fictional characters&#39; - Oxford Times&#39; Deliciously thrilling and wildly unpredictable&#39; - Oxford Today&#39; Amidst a sea of garbage your books stand out as well-written, convincing, and different&#39; - Michael Harrison, Lecturer on Oxford Murder &#39;It&#39;s refreshing to read an Oxford book which tells a gripping story from the Town point of view&#39; - Chris Williams, Oxford United Matchday Programme" />

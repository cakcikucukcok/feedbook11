  <title>Mistress of the Rock - Myron Edwards, Athina Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All is fair in love and war. Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Richard Cole, ex-veteran of the First Gulf War, the memories of conflict have become the nightmares of his reality, and only by confronting them can he begin to live again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returns to the Island of Cyprus some twenty years later to where it all began, for a vacation with his wife, Julie. But a chance discovery places him in a dilemma, as he learns that Greek Gods and mortals should never mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with Richard powerless to stop the momentum of a phenomenon that tests him to his limits, challenging all that he knows and loves against a fantasy of myth and legend, he must struggle to find the truth between what is real and what is not; but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the island of love, one man&amp;rsquo;s obsession turns to possession, as his mind, body, and soul are trapped between two worlds and two women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Mistress of the Rock is a very possessive spirit; she does not give her affections lightly.&amp;rsquo; As Richard Cole is about to discover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

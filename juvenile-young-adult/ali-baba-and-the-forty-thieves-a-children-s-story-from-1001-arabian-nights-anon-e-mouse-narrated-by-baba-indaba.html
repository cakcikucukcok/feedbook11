  <title>ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES - A Children’s Story from 1001 Arabian Nights - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 225&lt;br /&gt;
In this 225th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Arabian Nights story of &amp;ldquo;THE STORY OF ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away in a town in Persia lived two brothers named Cassim and Ali Baba, between whom their father at his death had left what little property he possessed equally divided. Ali married a wife as poor as himself, and having no other means of gaining a livelihood he used to go every day into the forest to cut wood, and lading therewith the three asses which were his sole stock-in-trade, would then hawk it about the streets for sale.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day while he was at work within the skirts of the forest, Ali Baba saw advancing towards him across the open a large company of horsemen, and fearing from their appearance that they might be robbers, he left his asses to their own devices and sought safety for himself in the lower branches of a large tree which grew in the close overshadowing of a precipitous rock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Almost immediately it became evident that this very rock was the goal toward which the troop was bound, for having arrived they alighted instantly from their horses, and took down each man of them a sack which seemed by its weight and form to be filled with gold. There could no longer be any doubt that they were robbers. Ali Baba counted forty of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just as he had done so, the one nearest to him, who seemed to be their chief, advanced toward the rock, and in a low but distinct voice uttered the two words &amp;quot;OPEN SESAME!&amp;quot; Immediately the rock opened like a door, the captain and his men passed in, and the rock closed behind them. And thus begins the story and adventures of Ali Baba.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

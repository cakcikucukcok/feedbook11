  <title>Water, Earth, Fire: Louisiana&#39;s Natural Heritage - Paul A. Keddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Louisiana is one of the most beautiful parts of North America. It offers much more than Mardi Gras and Bourbon Street. With 25 maps and 60 illustrations, this is the first book to introduce the full range of wild places in Louisiana. Certainly the states magnificent swamps are described, but Louisiana showcases a great diversity of natural habitats prairies, longleaf pine savannas, oak forests, Appalachian forest, river valleys, cliffs, sand dunes, and cheniers.  Each has its distinctive plant and animal species.  Frogs living in trees, fish digging burrows, pelicans nesting on offshore islands and plants eating insects, as well as wild orchids, dwarf palmettos, armadillos, and Some of the authors favorite places to visit are highlighted and he describes the challenge of conserving wild places for the enjoyment of future generations. The book is titled for the water that carries the earth that builds Louisiana, and the fires that create the prairies, pine forests, and savannas.  If you own only one book about Louisiana nature, this is the one to have a perfect gift for student, tourist, hunter, or neighbor.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Advance Praise&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an impressive guide to the magical and bountiful world of Louisiana nature,
and an excellent primer in why we should save itnot only for the sake of pelicans
and woodpeckers and tupelos, but for the sake of ourselves.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Michael Grunwald, author of &lt;i&gt;The Swamp: The Everglades, Florida and the
Politics of Paradise&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Paul Keddy captures what truly is the best about Louisianaits many and varied
natural habitats. Dr. Keddy is more than a gifted scientist. He takes the science out of
science. He describes complex processes in terms that are easy to understand, enlightening,
and enjoyable. From the rolling pine forest to cypress swamps to barrier islands; from
birds to bugs to bears; from frogs to fi sh, Dr. Keddy covers all that makes Louisiana one
of the most unique places on the good planet Earth.

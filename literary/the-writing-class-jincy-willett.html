  <title>The Writing Class - Jincy Willett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amy Gallup is gifted, perhaps too gifted for her own good. Published at only twenty-two, she peaked early and found critical but not commercial success. Now her former life is gone, along with her writing career and beloved husband. A reclusive widow, her sole companion a dour, flatulent basset hound who barely tolerates her, her daily mantra &lt;i&gt;Kill Me Now,&lt;/i&gt; she is a loner afraid to be alone. Her only bright spot each week is the writing class that she teaches at the university extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This semester&#39;s class is full of the usual suspects: the doctor who wants to be the next Robin Cook, the overly enthusiastic repeat student, the slacker, the unassuming student with the hidden talent, the prankster, the know-it-all.... Amy&#39;s seen them all before. But something is very different about this class---and the clues begin with a scary phone call in the middle of the night and obscene threats instead of peer evaluations on student writing assignments. Amy soon realizes that one of her students is a very sick puppy, and when a member of the class is murdered, everyone becomes a suspect. As she dissects each student&#39;s writing for clues, Amy must enlist the help of everyone in her class, including the murderer, to find the killer among them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspenseful, extremely witty, brilliantly written, unexpectedly hilarious, and a joy from start to finish, &lt;i&gt;The Writing Class&lt;/i&gt; is a one-of-a-kind novel that rivals Jincy Willett&#39;s previous masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;" />

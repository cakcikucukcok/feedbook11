  <title>The Rancher&#39;s Christmas Princess (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (The Bravo Royales, Book 3) - Christine Rimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Arabella Bravo-Calabretti came to Elk Creek, Montana, with a secret to deliver and a job to do. Being a Bravo Royale, she was going to do it right. Before she handed her best friend&#39;s darling son, Ben, over to his unwitting father, they would all spend Christmas together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only then could she be absolutely sure that rancher Preston McCade was ready to be a dad.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or…was that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the reason Belle was hanging around? She and Preston were practically from different planets, yet the attraction was undeniable. Before long, someone was utterly in love with a rancher–and Christmas in Montana was presenting one surprise after another.&lt;/p&gt;

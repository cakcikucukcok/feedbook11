  <title>Storm of the Gods - Amy Braun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, the gods of Greek legend returned to the world. Their return restored their powers, which had been spent in a cataclysmic battle with the Titans. With the ancient deities imprisoned in Tartarus, the Olympians now reside in&amp;nbsp;N&amp;eacute;o Vas&amp;iacute;leio, formerly known as California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Derek Aerios is a war scion, a descendent of Ares, the God of War. He and his brother, eighteen-year-old Liam, capture mythological creatures and rogue scions as part of Ares&amp;rsquo;s elite military force. As he struggles to cope with his violent powers and the scars of a traumatic childhood, Derek tries to keep the two vows he has made: protect his brother, and never kill a human again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Ares forces him to hunt and kill four rogue scions under Athena&amp;rsquo;s control&amp;mdash;by threatening Liam&amp;rsquo;s life&amp;mdash;Derek chooses to go after the scions in order to save his brother and keep his promise to himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the closer Derek gets to the scions, the more he realizes that his orders are part of a deeper conspiracy that put him at odds with his mission and his conscience. Athena may not be the enemy, a traitor could be in their midst, and the Titans could be closer to freedom than ever before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

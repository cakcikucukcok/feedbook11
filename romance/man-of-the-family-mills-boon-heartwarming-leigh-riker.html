            &lt;strong&gt;His children will always come first&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Griffin Lattimer has reinvented himself. He&#39;s gone from TV news anchor to single father, managing a Florida apartment complex so he can spend more time with his kids, making them the center of his life. And then Sunny Donovan has the gall to accuse his daughter of stealing. It&#39;s ridiculous, and Griffin refuses to listen…until he realizes the beautiful lawyer is telling the truth. She isn&#39;t letting him or his child off the hook, either, and they begin to recognize the tough love for what it is: she cares. She also makes it clear she can&#39;t stay. If Sunny goes back to New York, his kids will be heartbroken. And they won&#39;t be the only ones…&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Relucant Rapist - Earle Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am leaving Vancouver and I am leaving with a sour taste in my
mouth I have been screwed by the people that I thought were my
friends. I never believed this could happen to me I thought as city cop,
and a detective first class, I thought I was invincible. For the past five
years I supervised a squad of undercover drug cops I gained quite a
reputation my squad had the top arrest record they consistently collared
drug dealers than any other squad. But that was gone that was all in
the past. The mob had set me up I cannot understand by how could
I have been so stupid the mob planned the setup and I was fooled but
then so was the whole department fell for the scam. I was charged with
rape and I was fired but there had been no rape I was innocent. But
just the fact that I had been charged was all the commission needed.
They did not actually fire me they had no cause. They gave two
options I could resign with a partial pension or they would dismiss me
without stating a cause, if they discharged I could fight them in court
for wrongful dismissal, what chance would I have me Collin Winters
taking the police commission to court. I was a burr under their ass
before I was in narcotics; I was in robbery and murder when there was
a drug dealer killed it was natural for me to follow up on the murder
and I complained like hell about not getting any support. The chief
said drop it Collin the commission is not interested in more murder
reports its just collateral damage." />

  <title>The Meeting Book 2 - Lois Barleycorn Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When dealing with the problem of alcohol dependence in a loved one, we all need knowledgeable friends to guide us through the stormy seas of coping with the life events that we will experience. People who have walked before us. 
Although there is no magic pill we can give to the drinker to make them stop drinking, that does not mean we are helpless in the situation. We can change our approach, and very often, because of the changes we make in ourselves, the drinker chooses to change too.
The Meeting is a support group for the families and friends of alcoholics. By reading these experiences, you are being given the opportunity and privilege of sharing the wealth of wisdom these members have gained.
Explanations of what makes an addict remain elusive, but this is our experience of living with alcohol dependency problems in others. Many who stay the distance experience an emotional (or spiritual) awakening. It is often when we feel at the end of our world that we find surprisingly that that is where our real journey begins. 
There are real pearls of wisdom contained in these experiences you can benefit from if you are ready and willing to read with an open mind, but the suggestion is always to take what you like and leave the rest." />

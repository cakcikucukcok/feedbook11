  <title>The Repurposed Library - Lisa Occhipinti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt; We all love to read and learn from books, but &lt;I&gt;The Repurposed Library &lt;/I&gt;takes our passion even further, presenting us with 33 projects to make--quite literally--out of books. For these projects, Lisa Occhipinti rescues and repurposes orphaned and outdated books from flea markets and library sales and turns them into new art objects and practical items for the home. Her creations range from artfully constructed mobiles, wreaths, and vases, to functional items like shelves, storage boxes, and even a Kindle &quot;keeper&quot; for those who want to replicate the sensation of holding a &quot;real&quot; book while reading from an e-reader. Projects utilize every imaginable part of a book--from hardback cover to individual pages--and are a DIY celebration of a new way to view a book&#39;s potential.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;The Repurposed Library&lt;/I&gt;:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;In an age when the bound book is an endangered species, [Occhipinti&#39;s] artwork is nicely topical. She now has a book of her own, &lt;I&gt;The Repurposed Library&lt;/I&gt;, out this week from Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. In it, she offers readers a how-to guide to making household objects from, well, books, like a mirror, a lamp and a fire screen, as well as the winsome mobile shown on the cover.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;- The New York Times&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&quot;Book hoarders rejoice: all those random children&#39;s books, encyclopedias, and unread paperbacks are about to find their purpose . . . Furnished with cheery photographs and numerous hand-drawn diagrams, this endearing book will appeal to veteran crafters and literati alike.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;-&lt;I&gt;BUST &lt;/I&gt;magazine &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &quot;The book is really well-made, fittingly. The photography by Thayer Allyson Gowdy is wonderful and really shows off the projects--and everything in the background is as tastefully arranged as a Crate &amp; Barrel catalog. . . . if you love books as objects, &lt;I&gt;The Repurposed Library&lt;/I&gt; is a fun collection of project ideas.&quot;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt; --Wired.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &quot;We love how everyday objects like a colorful collection of vintage books can double as décor. . . .

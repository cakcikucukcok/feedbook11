  <title>Prohibition - Terrence McCauley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From the author of SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL comes a riveting crime thriller for fans of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, set in Prohibition-era New York.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The year is 1930 and New York is a city on the edge. Banks are failing. Companies are closing their doors. Breadlines grow longer by the day. The only market making money is the black market: racketeering, rum running, and speakeasies. But when even those vices begin to weaken, the most powerful gangster on the Eastern Sea-board, Archie Doyle, sees the writing on the wall. He launches a bold scheme that, if successful, will secure his empire&amp;#8217;s future beyond Prohibition. Beyond even the Great Depression. But when a mysterious rival attempts to kill Doyle&amp;#8217;s right hand man, a dangerous turf war begins to brew. With his empire under attack, Doyle turns to his best gun, former boxer Terry Quinn, for answers. Quinn must use his brains as well as his brawn to uncover who is behind the violence and why before Doyle&amp;#8217;s empire comes crashing down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Terrence McCauley whips up a fast paced pulp thriller ripe with Tommy-gun blasting hoods, corrupt cops and deadly dames in this original novel reminiscent of the classic gangster movies of old.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>The Sky Didn&#39;t Fall - Kerry Hardie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oh, let me live living, devoured and devouring, eating myself down to my own core.&#39; — When Maura had Died The Sky Didn&#39;t Fall is Kerry Hardie&#39;s third and most varied collection. Series of poems set in Switzerland, its ?elds of sun?owers, and on Achill, island of bones and stones&#39;, complement more familiar responses to the landscape and weather surrounding her Kilkenny home. To details such as the bare branches fruited&#39; with birds, the ?elds&#39; froth with ?owering grasses&#39; and the patience of June ?owers&#39;, she adds a number of narratives — or parables — in which experience yields a spiritual lesson and consolation. Human life quivers in consort with other lives in these seasons of the heart. Through sharper observation the author aspires to deeper thought, and her book&#39;s multiple lights of days and dusk reveal a calendar in which unplanted bulbs / are greening them-selves from within&#39;." />

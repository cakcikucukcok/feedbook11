  <title>Love the Sh!t Out of Yourself - Zoey Arielle Poulsen, Becca Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is changing all around us with increasing speed, making most of us feel we have no control.  We are so busy doing and being productive and bullet journaling our way through life that we might be riding on the back of our own bus. Positive Living and affirmation queen Zoey Poulsen has been to the edge of overwhelm and back again. While on her journey, she gathered a lot of wisdom and here is her big takeaway:
If you affirm yourself everyday, you can rule the world. More importantly, you can live a life filled with love, joy, fulfillment and satisfaction thanks to your own positive self-regard. 
Through the art of daily self-affirmation, you can take control of your own destiny and create your ideal life. If it sounds easy, it can be but it does require the discipline that you reflect upon a positive affirmation each day. These affirmations are a mindfulness practice that will strengthen your self-esteem. Like a muscle, the more you do it, the stronger your confidence and sense of self will be. Love the Sh*t Out of Yourself is the ultimate motivating, encouraging, and uplifting book to enjoy and share. These very wise words and affirmative sayings have the power to touch our hearts, make us laugh, alleviate our stress, while realizing the vast potential life has to offer. Grouped together, these quips, quotes, and &quot;power thoughts&quot; can help you deal with everything life throws at you with élan. Simply put, you’ll be too blessed to be stressed!" />

  <title>The Analects of Confucius - Confucius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Analects&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, also known as the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Analects of Confucius&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius&amp;#39; followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC&amp;ndash;221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the &lt;i&gt;Analects&lt;/i&gt; was considered merely a &amp;quot;commentary&amp;quot; on the Five Classics, but the status of the &lt;i&gt;Analects&lt;/i&gt; grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the &lt;i&gt;Analects&lt;/i&gt; as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the &amp;quot;Four Books&amp;quot;. The &lt;i&gt;Analects&lt;/i&gt; has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. They were very important for Confucianism and China&amp;#39;s overall morals." />

  <title>My Spirit Is Like the Eagle - Roy Forrester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Spirit Is Like the Eagle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; begins with a poem sharing its title with the book. The central image of the poet as an eagle provides a unique introduction to the variety of themes in this poetry collection. Some verses soar high above the landscape, while others swoop down from the heights to grasp the small gestures that make up daily life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poet Roy Forrester has Parkinsons disease, and it has changed his world dramatically. What began as a poem to his wife expressing his love for her has turned into a dynamic collection of poetry on many different topics, from love and passion to humour. He also writes of the frustrations he encounters with his disease. This debut poetry collection represents the end of a long journey for Forrester, and he invites you to join him in considering that journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My spirit is like the eagle. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is an illusion that I am bound to this earth by an aging body. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is an illusion, as is life itself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is an illusion that this existence is finite. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My spirit is like the eagle. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I, too, scan the earth below, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;and though I search for sustenance, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;sustenance for my soul, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;it is the beauty of the journey which fulfils me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

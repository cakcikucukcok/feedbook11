Was he right?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The vice presidency is one of America&#39;s most historically complicated, intriguing, and underappreciated public offices. And Jeremy Lott&#39;s sweeping, hilarious, and insightful history introduces readers to the unusual and sometimes shadowy cast of characters that have occupied it:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Aaron Burr, the only VP tried for treason&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;John Tyler, president without a party&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Andrew Johnson, defiant drunkard&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Thomas Marshall, who should have been president&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Richard Nixon, underdog and daredevil&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Gerald Ford, icon of the 1970s&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Al Gore, the most frustrated man in America&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;And, of course, the real Dick Cheney&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;With crisp prose, Lott focuses on their bitter rivalries and rank ambitions, their glorious victories and tragic setbacks. At the end of hundreds of historical vignettes, interviews, and pilgrimages to obscure places, Lott concludes that the vice presidency is an invaluable political institution that tends to frustrate the ambitions of America&#39;s most ambitious politicans--an ungainly launch pad for future political success and a drunk tank for those who would imbibe too deeply of power. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Answers to Quiz!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;OL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Fourteen of the forty-three presidents were vice president&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;It&#39;s happened eight times so far&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Aaron Burr and Dick Cheney&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Aaron Burr&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;John Tyler&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Because he insisted on being called &quot;president,&quot; not &quot;vice president&quot; or &quot;acting president&quot;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Aaron Burr (him again!)&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;None, though an assassin was hired to kill Andrew Johnson&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;See answers one and two and then ask yourself, &quot;Does America feel lucky?&quot;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt; &lt;P&gt;Answers to bonus challenge: Alexander Hamilton and Harry Whittington&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Score:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;0-4 You are a novice who should probably buy this book&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;5-8 You are a history buff who should love this book&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;9-12 You are a smart cookie who should appear on Jeopardy--and buy this book for show prep&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;" />

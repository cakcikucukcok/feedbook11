  <title>A Body of Divinity - Thomas Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thomas Watson&#39;s Body of Practical Divinity is one of the most precious of the peerless works of the Puritans; and those best acquainted with it, prize it most. Watson was one of the most concise, racy, illustrative, and suggestive of those eminent divines who made the Puritan age the Augustan period of evangelical literature. There is a happy union of sound doctrine, heart-searching experience and practical wisdom throughout all his works; and his Body of Divinity is, beyond all the rest, useful to the student and the minister. He explains the Doctrines of God, Divine Sovereignty, Salvation, Sin, and the Trinity with remarkable clarity. His thinking is sound and Scriptural. Puritan theology sets the diadem of our salvation on Christ, and Christ alone, and it is solely on the basis of his meritorious work that we are saved." />

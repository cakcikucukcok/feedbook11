  <title>Grow Your Value - Mika Brzezinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;A woman who wants to be successful must make sacrifices, but how can she determine which ones she&amp;#39;ll be happy with five, ten, twenty years from now?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mika Brzezinski, &lt;I&gt;Morning Joe&lt;/I&gt; co-host and &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; best-selling author of &lt;I&gt;Knowing Your Value,&lt;/I&gt; has built a career on inspiring women to assess and then obtain their true value in the workplace. In her books and in her conferences, Mika gives women the tools necessary to advocate for themselves and their financial futures. But that is only the first step; once you know your value, you need to &lt;I&gt;grow&lt;/I&gt; it&amp;#151;both professionally and personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on deeply revealing conversations with powerful and dynamic women, input from researchers and relationship experts, and her own wealth of experience, Mika helps women pinpoint their individual definition of success. She advises her readers to define the &amp;#147;professional value&amp;#8221; that encompasses their worth in the workplace, and the &amp;#147;inner value&amp;#8221; made up of their core beliefs and goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Women can stop feeling overwhelmed, overscheduled, frantic, and forever guilty&amp;#151;but only if they choose their objectives confidently and unapologetically, and focus their efforts accordingly. Mika encourages women to stop seeking the unobtainable &amp;#147;work-life balance,&amp;#8221; and instead pursue a life of honesty and authenticity, where career and home life combine rather than collide.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

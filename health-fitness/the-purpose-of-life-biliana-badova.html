  <title>The Purpose of Life - Biliana Badova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today, we are living faster, more stressful lives than ever before. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel lost and get wrapped up in wealth, greed and materialism. I know, because it happened to me. It took me a while to realise this, as on the surface, I was doing very well &amp;ndash; I had a good job, a good lifestyle, and lots of nice things around me. But without really realising, I had lost touch with the people who really mattered to me. I was empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started to talk to my friends, I realised this was a common problem. In this book, I share my thoughts on how to live a happier life. It is based on my personal journey of discovery and experiences that either I or my close friends have gone through. I cover: emotions, relationships, problems, life lessons, and offer my final thoughts for a more positive way of living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that we will all have bad days, or even bad patches, but it&amp;rsquo;s how we deal with them that counts. I hope this book will inspire you to live a more meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

          &lt;strong&gt;Pregnant at the Wedding&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After their one unforgettable night, Ashley Smith knew she must tell Ryan Warner she was carrying his child. And when he insists upon marriage, she agrees for the baby’s sake… His wealth, his power, his position are immaterial. The passion is still intense between them; dare Ashley take a chance on this billion-dollar bachelor?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Seduced by the Enemy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ruthless Texas multi-millionaire Nick Colton was her most bitter business rival, yet Abby Taylor’s dreams of Nick are the most intimate she’s ever experienced. She is powerless to control her desires when he is near. And she fears that Nick’s betrayal, when it comes, will shatter her forever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Wed to the Texan Tycoon &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jake Thorne needs to find a wife and to start a family – fast – to claim an inheritance. His shy secretary Emily Carlisle seems the perfect choice. She has the sweetest, most tempting lips he’s ever tasted. But Jake finds he will have to convince his new wife to fall in love with him.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Nightmare at Turtle Lake - June E. Hudy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The accident that took the life of the young boy was the worst day in Mitchells life. Even though it was unavoidable, he felt terrible. He tried to put it behind him and take the family to Turtle Lake and enjoy his much deserved holiday. But a calm, relaxing holiday was not to be. As things went from bad to worse, Mitchell started to realize what was really important in his life. It wasnt his job, being in control or always being right; it was his family. Protecting his wife and children was the only thing that really mattered, but doing that when the enemy was unknown was the hardest thing he ever had to face. Follow along with Mitchell on his quest to discover who was out to destroy his family and make him suffer, even to the point of taking his life." />

  <title>Pieces of Her - Karin Slaughter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMING TO NETFLIX!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother. Hero. Liar. Killer. How can you tell when all you have is...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIECES OF HER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if the person you thought you knew best turns out to be someone you never knew at all . . . ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea knows everything about her mother, Laura. She knows she&amp;#8217;s spent her whole life in the small beachside town of Belle&amp;#160;Isle; she knows she&amp;#8217;s never wanted anything more than to live a quiet life as a pillar of the community; she knows she&amp;#8217;s never kept a secret in her life. Because we all know our mothers, don&amp;#8217;t we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all that changes when a&amp;#160;trip to the mall explodes into violence and Andrea suddenly sees a completely different side to Laura. Because it turns out that before Laura was Laura, she was someone completely different. For nearly thirty years she&amp;#8217;s been hiding from her previous identity, lying low in the hope that no one would ever find her. But now she&amp;#8217;s been exposed, and nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police want answers and Laura&amp;#8217;s innocence is on the line, but she won&amp;#8217;t speak to anyone, including her own daughter. Andrea is on a desperate journey following the breadcrumb trail of her mother&amp;#8217;s past. And if she can&amp;#8217;t uncover the secrets hidden there, there may be no future for either one of them. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />

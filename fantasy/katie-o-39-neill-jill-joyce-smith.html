  <title>Katie O&#39;neill - Jill Joyce Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If there was one thing that Katie ONeill was sure of it was that life was not as God had anticipated it to be.  Being brought up in a small Christian town had left Katie exposed to the flaws of those who would hide behind the pretense of faith and religion.  Dana, the Mother Goddess of the Tuatha, one of the first peoples of Ireland, had the answers Katie was seeking but also had plans of Her own for the young woman.  
Katie and her best friend Jonathan had just graduated from High School and one day, while sitting under their favorite tree, Dana appears before them.  She magically transports them both back to Ireland in the year of 357 BC, 300 years before the first Celt invasion.  It is then that Katie discovers that her true destiny is to be the next High Priestess of the Tuatha clan but not before she proves herself worthy of the position and is sent by the King of Ulster on a dangerous quest to find the valuable treasures that have been hidden from her and her companions. With the help of her friends, old and new, she begins her journey around ancient Ireland.  She puts herself in perilous quandaries but persists in being dedicated to find the four jewels that belong to the Tuatha and bring them back to the people of her new clan. Luckily her new friends have taught her well of the ancient ways and have equipped her with the forgotten wisdoms of the past.  During her search she meets many of Irelands fabled Fey folk who assist her with her quest. But some that she encounters are as mischievous as the myths say.  
Katie ONeill: Quest of the Four Jewels is a charming tale of adventure and romance." />

  <title>The Anointing of Ease - V.K. Fields</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Followers of Christ should follow Christ . . . and His example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard a sermon that sounded something like this? &amp;quot;If you are a child of God, you are either in the middle of a storm, coming out of a storm, or going into a storm.&amp;quot; Ironically, the example we are given in the Bible is of Jesus resting during the storm and awakening only to silence the storm. He said, &amp;#39;Peace, be still.&amp;#39; He did not fear the storm, worry about the storm, or curse the storm. He spoke to the storm, and the storm responded in obedience to His words and to His will. That is our example. When we follow His example, we should also get His results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your life should not be defined by the storm, because the storm is subject to you and your authority through Christ Jesus. In &lt;em&gt;The Anointing of Ease&lt;/em&gt;, author V.K. Fields shares how to reclaim God&amp;#39;s original intent for your life of ease through His blessings and promises.&lt;/p&gt;" />

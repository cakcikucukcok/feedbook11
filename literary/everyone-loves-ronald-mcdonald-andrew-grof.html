  <title>Everyone Loves Ronald McDonald - Andrew Grof</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a zany romp through the modern American landscape, with the tour guide one Bingo Sherman, a possible descendant of the controversial Civil War general. Bingo, a joyous cross between Salinger’s Holden Caulfield and Kafka’s Joseph K attacks life with a zest that belies his Florida Panhandle origins. In this coming of age novel the action moves briefly from Miami’s South Beach to New York’s Upper West Side then back to South Beach again. Bingo is a seeker with a difference: he has absolutely no idea what he is seeking and knows only what he is not ready to settle for. The characters he encounters along the way serve to both open his eyes as well as to toughen him up for life’s many trials still ahead. Throughout the novel looms the almost mythical figure of Ronald McDonald, Bingo’s childhood hero for whom he still harbors a soft spot in his heart. Everyone Loves Ronald McDonald strikes just the right tone between irreverence and acute observation, and promises a rollicking good experience for anyone with common or even uncommon good sense." />

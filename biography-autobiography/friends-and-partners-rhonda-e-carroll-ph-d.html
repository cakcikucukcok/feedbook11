      <meta name="description" content="It was 2006 when I moved out of my birth country for the first time. I had thought that once I arrived in my new country and got snuggled into my apartment and got comfortable, I would send a quick e-mail to so many who were interested in my well-being. 
How was I to know that, seven years later, I would have lived a life with exhilarating stories accumulated from my exciting life? 
In this latest work, you will read of the countless stories that transpired over the years as a result of maintaining a life that has been full of escapades, full of options, full of adventures, and full of possibilities. You will also read the things that my friends and partners have been able to be a part of for years, so enjoy the stories." />

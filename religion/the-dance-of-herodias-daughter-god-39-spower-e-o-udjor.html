  <title>The Dance of Herodias Daughter - God&#39;spower E O Udjor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no generation that has fallen under satanic deception like this where in we live. The first and most destructive reason is that we have wrongly defined MINISTERIAL SUCCESS.
The emphasis in Joshua 1:8 is not just on success but on GOOD success...that suggest that its possible to have bad or wrong success. God Himself knows what good success is thats why He says it only comes by the WORD. Unfortunately we are witnessing a generation who lives in total deception. Deceiving and being deceived. Satan is not practically disturbed whether we mention Jesus is Lord or not. He has confidently created a counterfeit Church to dilute or make nonsense the genuineness of the gospel. Falsehood seems to thrive, masked within the envelope of large sized congregation, miracles and prophecies.
This book looks at how Satan has infiltrated the church, how some celebrated Christian leaders who started out well has gradually slide into the camp of the enemy and has become tools in Satans hand to woo  unsuspecting young ministers into cultic practices.... It also reveals what the true church is, Gods definition of what success is and his plan for the church and will as we close this age." />

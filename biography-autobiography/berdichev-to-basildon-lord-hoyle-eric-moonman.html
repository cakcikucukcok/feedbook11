  <title>Berdichev to Basildon - Lord Hoyle, Eric Moonman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have often thought how my life would have been if I had started off in Basildon and ended up in Berdichev. Put it down to the sliding door of your lifeevents happen differently to what you prepare for, which is well described in a 1998 film by Peter Howitt.
The simple fact is that I got stuck in the advice business, and I am still in there. It is something to be an MP with the largest constituency in the country, but it is quite another to have to keep an eye on the Jewish community, which has kept me up all night. And I have never fully recovered.
Many of the quirks of life can be explained by being in the right place and at the right time. (In Yiddish, there is also a long-standing attempt to explain the events which you cannot predict but happens anyway. Its beshert. Then there is the nice warning sign for those who look too closely into the futureman tracht and got lacht [in English, it may not have the same cutting edge, man plans and G-d laughs])." />

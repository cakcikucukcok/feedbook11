  <title>The Body In The Belfry - Katherine Hall Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Body in the Belfry, &lt;/i&gt;the first volume in Katherine Hall Page&#39;s cozy mystery series featuring amateur sleuth Faith Fairchild&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;During her years spent in New York City, Faith Fairchild was convinced she had seen pretty much everything. But the transplanted caterer/minister&#39;s wife was unprepared for the surprises awaiting her in the sleepy Massachusetts village of Aleford. And she is especially taken aback by the dead body of a pretty young thing she discovers stashed in the church&#39;s belfry. The victim, Cindy Shepherd, was well-known locally for her acid tongue and her jilted beaux, which created a lot of bad blood and more than a few possible perpetrators -- including her luckless fiancé, who had neither an alibi nor a better way to break off the engagement. Faith thinks it&#39;s terribly unfair that the police have zeroed in on the hapless boyfriend, and so she sets out to uncover the truth. But digging too deeply into the sordid secrets of a small New England village tends to make the natives nervous. And an overly curious big city lady can become just another small town death statistic in very short order.&lt;/p&gt;" />

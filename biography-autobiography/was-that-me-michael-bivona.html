  <title>Was That Me? - Michael Bivona</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his memoir &lt;i&gt;Was That Me?,&lt;/i&gt; a successful businessman, author, and philanthropist provides an inspirational look into the reasons why he chose the road he did in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After being repeatedly asked the question, &lt;i&gt;How did you go from not attending high school to becoming the man you are today?&lt;/i&gt; Bivonas answer was always the same: lots of luck and fate. But soon, that answer did not seem to be enough; and, as Bivona delved into past experiences in order to discover what truly caused him to reach his current destination, he began to identify the influences that propelled him from a childhood in a rundown neighborhood to a stint in the Air Force to his first jobs at Coney Island Amusement Park and a Wall Street stockbrokerage firm. As Bivona relays how he eventually attended Long Island University and became a certified public accountant, it is evident that self-determination and a thirst for knowledge guided him to attain success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The true story of how Michael Bivonas choices in life helped him become who he is today will inspire anyone to examine their own turning points and learn that sometimes opening the door to the unknown is what leads to true happiness." />

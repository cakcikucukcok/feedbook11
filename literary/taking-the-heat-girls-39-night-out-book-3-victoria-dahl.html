  <title>Taking the Heat (Girls&#39; Night Out, Book 3) - Victoria Dahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Passion this hot can&#39;t be faked…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All revved up for bright lights and steamy nights, writer Veronica Chandler chased her dreams to New York City. When she hit a dead end, reality sent her back home to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Saving her pride and her new gig–writing a relationship advice column!–requires some faking. No one can know the truth about her big-city flop or her nonexistent sex life. But the town&#39;s irresistibly rugged librarian is determined to figure her out…and give her hands-on lessons in every wicked thing she wants to know.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabe MacKenzie&#39;s heart might be in Wyoming, but secretly his future&#39;s tied up in his family&#39;s Manhattan legacy. Getting down and dirty with Veronica is supposed to give him a few memorable nights–not complicate his plans. But the thing about heat this scorching is there&#39;s just no going back…and it might be too hot for either of them to take.&lt;/p&gt;

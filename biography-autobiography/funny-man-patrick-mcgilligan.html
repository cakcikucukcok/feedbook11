  <title>Funny Man - Patrick McGilligan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deeply textured and compelling biography of comedy giant Mel Brooks, covering his rags-to-riches life and triumphant career in television, films, and theater, from Patrick McGilligan, the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Young Orson: The Years of Luck and Genius on the Path to Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oscar, Emmy, Tony, and Grammy award&amp;#8211;winner Mel Brooks was behind (and sometimes in front the camera too) of some of the most influential comedy hits of our time, including &lt;em&gt;The 2,000 Year Old Man, Get Smart, The Producers, Blazing Saddles,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Young Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. But before this actor, writer, director, comedian, and composer entertained the world, his first audience was his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth and last child of Max and Kitty Kaminsky, Mel Brooks was born on his family&amp;#8217;s kitchen table in Brooklyn, New York, in 1926, and was not quite three-years-old when his father died of tuberculosis. Growing up in a household too poor to own a radio, Mel was short and homely, a mischievous child whose birth role was to make the family laugh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond boyhood, after transforming himself into Mel Brooks, the laughs that came easily inside the Kaminsky family proved more elusive. His lifelong crusade to transform himself into a brand name of popular humor is at the center of master biographer Patrick McGilligan&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Funny Man&lt;/em&gt;. In this exhaustively researched and wonderfully novelistic look at Brooks&amp;#8217; personal and professional life, McGilligan lays bare the strengths and drawbacks that shaped Brooks&amp;#8217; psychology, his willpower, his persona, and his comedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGilligan insightfully navigates the epic ride that has been the famous funnyman&amp;#8217;s life story, from Brooks&amp;#8217;s childhood in Williamsburg tenements and breakthrough in early television&amp;#8212;working alongside Sid Caesar and Carl Reiner&amp;#8212;to Hollywood and Broadway peaks (and valleys). His book offers a meditation on the Jewish immigrant culture that influenced Brooks, snapshots of the golden age of comedy, behind the scenes revelations about the celebrated shows and films, and a telling look at the four-decade romantic partnership with actress Anne Bancroft that superseded Brooks&amp;#8217; troubled first marriage. Engrossing, nuanced and ultimately poignant, &lt;em&gt;Funny Man&lt;/em&gt; delivers a great man&amp;#8217;s unforgettable life story and an anatomy of the American dream of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funny Man&lt;/em&gt; includes a 16-page black-and-white photo insert.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Glimpsing into the Kingdom - Paul Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Friend, your sins are forgiven.
That is what Jesus said. And that is good news indeed. 
Now what?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is the question that confronts all of us who come to faith in Christ. Just as the demon-possessed man was left with a gnawing sense of unknowing, we are left with that same feeling. We know that what we were is not what we are to be. And we know that the process of becoming is a great metamorphosis.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To understand the glimpses of truth in the kingdom teachings is to peer down the road a ways into a great adventure with God.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this new kingdom we have entered, the king himself calls us friend and tells us something brand new about us: our sins are forgiven. Whereas before our identities have been forged by brokenness, deception, shame, and hurt, our new identities are something else altogether. We are kingdom citizens, intent on being about the business of the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Positive - Paige Rawl, Ali Benjamin, Jay Asher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An astonishing memoir for the untold number of children whose lives have been touched by bullying.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Positive&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a must-read for teens, their parents, educators, and administrators&amp;#8212;a brave, visceral work that will save lives and resonate deeply.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paige Rawl has been HIV positive since birth, but growing up, she never felt like her illness defined her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an unremarkable day in middle school, she disclosed to a friend her HIV-positive status&amp;#8212;and within hours the bullying began. From that moment forward, every day was like walking through a minefield. Paige was never sure when or from where the next text, taunt, or hateful message would come. Then one night, desperate for escape, fifteen-year-old Paige found herself in her bathroom staring at a bottle of sleeping pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have been the end of her story. Instead, it was only the beginning. Paige&#39;s memoir, co-written with bestselling author Ali Benjamin (&lt;em&gt;The Truth About Jellyfish&lt;/em&gt;), calls for readers to choose action over complacency, compassion over cruelty&amp;#8212;and above all, to be&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Positive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes twenty-five photos from Paige&#39;s personal collection throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paige continues to speak publicly about HIV and bullying, participate in conferences, and contribute to advocacy projects in and beyond her home state of Indiana. Paige has served as an ambassador&amp;#160;for the&amp;#160;Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. She hopes that her continued work in this field can help change the way her generation thinks and talks about HIV/AIDS and bullying. To all HIV-positive youth, Paige consistently affirms, &amp;#8220;You are living with HIV, but HIV is not who you are.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />

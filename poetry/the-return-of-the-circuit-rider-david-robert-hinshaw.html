  <title>The Return of the Circuit Rider - David Robert Hinshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In the process of writing two short collections of light hearted material, (one published and one yet to be published), the author became acutely aware
        that he could not continue forward without addressing what he considered to be the most important issues of human existence.  All of us have asked
        ourselves the questions, &quot;What is the meaning of life&quot; and &quot;Why am I here&quot;?  Some have rejected the idea of an eternal soul, some are undecided, while
        others are largely unconcerned, but the author has chosen to embrace the concept and run with it.  He believes there is a single overriding mission for
        every individual alive today.  The sole purpose of this life is to prepare for the next one, and every person has been given the ability to control his
        own destiny.  When compared to eternity, our lives are like a single knot in a rope that stretches around the world.  From the foundation of the earth,
        a plan has been in place to allow humanity to share the wonders of eternity with the Creator of all things.  Those who follow that plan will be
        rewarded accordingly, while those who prefer to separate themselves from the influence of a Higher Power, will be granted their wish in eternity.  If
        this book convinces one person to follow the plan that leads to redemption, then it will have been well worth the effort.

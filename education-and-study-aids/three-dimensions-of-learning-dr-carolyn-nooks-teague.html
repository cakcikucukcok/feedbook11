  <title>Three Dimensions of Learning - Dr. Carolyn Nooks Teague</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three Dimensions of Learning: A Blueprint for Learning from the Womb to the School is an informative guidebook designed to help parents and educators become more aware of the ways in which they can stifle or empower the future of the child. It follows the development of the whole child from life inside the womb to life in the school. At every stage the importance of addressing the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual states of the child is emphasized.&lt;br /&gt;
For the first two dimensions of learning, the womb and the home, parents are in charge. The author encourages parents to develop resiliency in their children to help prepare them for life outside of the home. Do you know how to develop resiliency in your child? Have you taught him or her how to deal with bullying? Parents are reminded of developmental milestones and how to use them. Home tests and activities are provided to help parents support normal development as well as recognize the symptoms of possible developmental delays or conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
 The role of the teacher is highlighted during the third dimension of learning. Teachers are encouraged to connect to each child at an emotional level, to seek knowledge of the childs interests, talents and passions. Information that will increase the teachers awareness of hidden disabilities and how to recognize their symptoms is provided. For example, do you have a student that leans to one side when reading or complains about tags in clothing? The author shares science-informed teaching strategies that demonstrate how the brain learns and how being aware of this can change a childs life. &lt;br /&gt;
Dont miss this opportunity to bolster your understanding of how the mind works and become a better parent, educator and or administrator with Three Dimensions of Learning.&lt;/p&gt;" />

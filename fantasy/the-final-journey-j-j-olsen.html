  <title>The Final Journey - J.J. Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The journey of Jenny Dewberry&#39;s magical life continues in the fourth book as she fights the most nefarious, evil demon ever to exist. This demon, the Emperor of the underground, the greatest Sorcerer ever, is the cause of all the corruption going on in Oceanview, where Jenny and her family and friends live. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The once safe and beautiful city is now in turmoil and is altered to blackness and despair. The minds of snippits are turning evil and are under the spell of the unknown demon that Jenny has to find. She has no idea who he is or how to find him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The demon, King of Darkness, wants to destroy all of white magic by taking over the World of Witchery and banishing the Washena and Wizard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jenny comes back from rescuing the Mystic Kingdom to find her world turned upside down. Her parents are missing and may be dead. Her home is in total chaos and she is the only one who can save them. It is now up to Jenny to find the demon that is responsible for all the devastation in their lives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The secret lies in an evil book hidden in the secret chamber in the underworld, Endfoenation, which is almost impossible to find. As Jenny becomes closer to unraveling the mystery behind this corrupt creature, it becomes more treacherous than Jenny ever could have imagined. The danger is too much for her. Is the thirteen year old witch&#39;s power strong enough to withstand the powerful demon and to fight such evilness? Can she fight off the shrewdness of the Demon of Darkness and gain her worlds back and keep white magic safe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Read the thrilling, conclusion of Jenny Dewberry and solve the biggest mystery ever . . . who is the King of Darkness? &lt;/p&gt;" />

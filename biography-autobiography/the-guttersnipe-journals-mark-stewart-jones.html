  <title>The Guttersnipe Journals - Mark Stewart-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;I am not homeless- I&#39;m just someone who can&#39;t go home&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;With these words, the young man known as Guttersnipe begins his account of two years spent living on the streets of Canterbury. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Amongst the struggles he must face every day there is one that he never anticipated; that of boredom and how to occupy his time. Acting on a friend&#39;s advice on how to combat this problem, he begins to write his thoughts down each day. He records his observations, his ideas, his memories and his own life story. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;It is these writings that form the basis of The Guttersnipe Journals. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Guttersnipe&#39;s story does not simply focus on the hardships that keep him apart from society - but rather he finds the common threads of human experience that bond us all together. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;It is a story that everyone should read.&lt;/P&gt;

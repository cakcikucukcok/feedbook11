  <title>The Sheriff of Shelter Valley (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Shelter Valley Stories, Book 5) - Tara Taylor Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;WHO IS BETH ALLEN? AND WHO–OR WHAT–IS SHE RUNNING FROM?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beth only wishes she knew. Six months ago, she woke up in a shabby Arizona hotel room with no memory of her past. What she did have was a bruised face, $2,000 in cash–and a little boy who called her &quot;Mama.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What&#39;s her real name? Is she a victim or a criminal? The child&#39;s savior or his kidnapper? Until her memory returns and she can answer those questions, Beth knows she has to hide. She&#39;s chosen Shelter Valley as her sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The town welcomed her, as it welcomes all others, and Beth has begun to fashion a new life for herself and her child. But when she falls in love with Greg Richards, her sense of sanctuary is threatened. Because Greg&#39;s the sheriff of Shelter Valley–the one man who could uncover the truth about her past, a truth that might destroy the woman she&#39;s become.&lt;/p&gt;

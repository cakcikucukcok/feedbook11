  <title>The Purple Land - William Henry Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1885, &quot;The Purple Land&quot; is a novel by  Argentinian naturalist and author William Henry Hudson. It tells the story of a young Englishman called Richard Lamb who elopes with a teenage Argentinian girl to Uruguay. Once there, Lamb sets off to find work, but instead finds himself at the centre of an epic adventure. This exciting and beautifully-written page-turner is not to be missed by fans and collectors of Hudson&#39;s wonderful work, and it would make for a worthy addition to any collection. William Henry Hudson (1841 - 1922) was an Argentinian naturalist, author, and ornithologist. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is best known for his novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904). Other notable works include &quot;A Crystal Age&quot; (1887) and &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918), which has since been adapted into a film. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />

  <title>The Rancher&#39;s Miracle Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Men of Raintree Ranch, Book 4) - April Arrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;EVERY MIRACLE HAS A PRICE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Barrel racer Tammy Jenkins has outrun a lot of things in her life. A tornado is not one of them. She barely manages to find shelter and safety at the ranch of a handsome stranger, but the storm is swift and merciless in its destruction. Now Tammy&#39;s cowboy hero needs her help caring for a newly orphaned baby boy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alex Weston had given up on ever having a family of his own. However, with the arrival of Tammy and the baby, his home is suddenly brightened by laughter, warmth and Tammy&#39;s graceful beauty. As much as his heart aches for more, Alex knows this is a temporary arrangement. Baby Brody needs a real family—something Tammy deserves, too. But can Alex let them go?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The People Who Changed the World - R.K. Srivastava</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book portrays the world history in an entirely new landscape which highlights the pace of development of all the major civilizations of the world since the dawn of human history. Mans rational behavior compelled him to search and innovate new things in order to emerge victorious in his struggle for existence, and in the process, he elevated human civilization. But different civilizations developed on different lines. Some were fast initially but later turned static, and some were static initially but later gained momentum to become world leaders, while some were in between. The author has broadly categorizes all the world civilizations into seven segments and demonstrated their behavior of development graphically. Indian civilization has been evaluated as initially glorious and highly developed, but later it turned static due to several inherent factors. Anglo-Saxon civilization has been adjudged as initially primitive and after AD 1000 it began to move slowly and later gained pace to become world leader. It has been suggested in the book that Indians should learn from the Anglo-Saxons and should follow their road to development, which has been heavily propitiated with scientific and technological innovations and rational thinking since AD 1000." />

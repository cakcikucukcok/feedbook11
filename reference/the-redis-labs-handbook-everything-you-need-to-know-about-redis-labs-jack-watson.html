  <title>The Redis Labs Handbook - Everything You Need To Know About Redis Labs - Jack Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Asked to explain why a few people truly excel, most people offer one of two answers. The first is hard work. Yet we all know plenty of hard workers who have been doing the same job for years or decades without becoming great. The other possibility is that the elite possess an innate talent for excelling in their field. We assume that Einstein was born with an astounding gift for maths, and Bill Gates carries a gene for brilliant investing. The trouble is, scientific evidence doesn&#39;t support the notion that specific natural talents make great performers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both the hard work and natural talent camps are wrong. What really makes the difference is a highly specific kind of effort-&#39;deliberate practice&#39;-that few of us pursue when we&#39;re practicing golf or piano, stockpicking or reaching for Redis Labs goals. Based on best practices research, &lt;i&gt;&#39;The Redis Labs Handbook&#39;&lt;/i&gt; shares the secrets of extraordinary performance and provides the tools to apply Redis Labs principles. It features real life stories through deliberate practice and achievements of Redis Labs goals. PLUS, INCLUDED with your purchase, are real-life document resources; this kit is available for instant download, giving you the tools to navigate and deliver on any Redis Labs goal." />

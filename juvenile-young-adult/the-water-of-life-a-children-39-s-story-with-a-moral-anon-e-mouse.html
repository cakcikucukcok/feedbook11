  <title>THE WATER OF LIFE - A Children&#39;s Story with a Moral - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 378&lt;br /&gt;
In this 378th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE WATER OF LIFE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A well-liked king is dying and the whole kingdom fears for his life. One of his three sons says, &amp;ldquo;I know he will be restored if he drinks the Waters of Life.&amp;rdquo; And so the three Princes depart immediately and go their separate ways to find the sacred spring of life-giving water.&lt;br /&gt;
The two elder brothers were proud and arrogant and thought if they brought the waters of life to their father, they would inherit the kingdom. But the youngest had no such thoughts, instead he was filled with kindness and compassion for his father and his fellow man.&lt;br /&gt;
Well what happened to the three brothers and did their father survive? Did they have adventures on the quest for the water you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;

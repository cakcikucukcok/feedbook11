      <meta name="description" content="THE GREED OF GOLDFEVER:
Captain Cat and the Umbrella Kid go for gold!! From a strawberry farm infested with North American Apache Attack snails; to hanging from a zeppelin high above Maxburg City; to a tropical isle guarded by Giant Robot Crabs, the Tremendous Two have no time to catch their breaths, let alone hold them. Someones made all the gold in the Lockstock Stockade Gold Depository smell Absolutely Stinky. But is this only the First Step in a pongy plot to plunder the gold vaults? Who can be behind it? Sultry saboteur Dinah Myte? Evil mad scientist Dr von Feendkraven? Surely it cant be Eddie Goldfever the world famous rock star? Join the Captain and the Kid as they tackle head-on the all-consuming Greed of Goldfever!
THE SARDINES OF SUSPICION: 
Captain Cats penthouse HQ is flooded and pumped full of piranha!! A seemingly unprovoked attack by gross gangster Fish-Face. But this is only a pulse-pounding prelude. Greater perils awaitBeneath the dark, placid waters of the Squidd Sardine Farm something stirs. An enormous sardine-guzzling sea-serpent! But surely such things dont exist? Captain Cat and the Umbrella Kid investigate *and discover Mystery upon Mystery. Who is the sinister man in black weaving a Tibetan ghost-trap around the lake? Who is the face-swapping traitor behind all the sabotage at the Sardine Farm? Diving-bells are attacked, Ye Olde Country Tea-Roomes are machine-gunned, and assorted heroes are sucked up by giant vacuum-cleaners before one thing is finally made clear: the Sardines of Suspicion cast their sinister shadow over everyone, and No One Can Be Trusted * not even Captain Cat!" />

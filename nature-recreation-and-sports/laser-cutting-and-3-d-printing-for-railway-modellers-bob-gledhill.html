  <title>Laser Cutting and 3-D Printing for Railway Modellers - Bob Gledhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although most people have heard of laser-cut and 3-D printed model railway parts and kits, most modellers have little knowledge or experience of them.  This fascinating and well-illustrated book describes in non-technical language how these machines work and how railway modellers can use them to produce remarkable models for their layouts.  With reference to the different modelling scales, the author discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of different types of machines, and the materials they employ. He also shows how beginners can install and use &#39;Sketchup Make&#39;, a free CAD (Computer Aided Design) program from the Internet.  With step-by-step instructions and accompanying photographs, the author takes the modeller through the early stages of using this program before providing many examples of how to design model railway related items such as laser-cut roofing tiles, palisade fencing, brickwork, and the detailed elements of station awning.  In addition, he demonstrates how to create 3-D printed furniture, barrels, packing crates, guttering and down pipes, rivet heads, and a workman&#39;s hut.The CAD skills learnt whilst following the clear instructions on how to draw these examples will enable modellers to design their own model railway parts, which can either be produced on their own machines or be sent away to be created by one of the many &#39;bureau&#39; companies. Clear step-by-step instructions are given along with over 430 superb colour images." />

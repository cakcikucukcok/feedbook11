  <title>As I Recall - George H. Tsegeletos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;b&gt;AS I RECALL&lt;/b&gt;, is a series of short stories recalling
personal experiences of the author when a young Marine serving in Korea.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Unlike most memoirs describing the horrors
of war Tsegeletos describes the sights, sounds and what is most fascinating,
the thoughts that ran through his mind during each incident.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;An occasional quip added while engaged in
life threatening action, brings to the reader lighthearted relief to what at
the very least is serious business indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;At the age of 17, George along with many of his high school
friends joined a Marine reserve unit located close to home. 1950 and half way
around the globe North Korea invaded South Korea, but to these young Marines it
seemed too far away to be of much concern. Looking forward to their graduation,
summer vacation and beginning a new career, whether college or work, their
world is suddenly turned upside down when they are rushed into a very uncertain
military future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;From his first step on North Korean soil through each story
that follows, including the final narrative describing the experience of
survival in the cold frozen environment during the epic Chosin Reservoir
Campaign, you will be taking each step with him.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Included are illustrations interspersed between stories and
copies of actual letters sent home.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The
book leaves you with a true picture of life in a foxhole as seen through the
eyes of a young Marine. Tsegeletos will hold the readers attention and win the
hearts of all moms with a young son in the U.S. Marines.&lt;/p&gt;

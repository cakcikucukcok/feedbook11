  <title>Recovery from Anger Addiction - Verryl V. Fosnight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Book Presents a Paradigm Shift About Toxic Anger: Anger Is An Addiction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the wisdoms of John Bradshaw, Pia Mellody, Claudia Black, Alice Miller, and many other recovery giants, Verryl grew to understand himself in the context of his past traumas. He was finally able to apply all the theories of these authors to heal his anger and rage. This expansion of theory to the emotion of toxic anger results in a revolutionary new concept of anger as an addiction. This paradigm shift empowers a person to recover from rage as an ill person seeking to be well, as opposed to a bad person trying to act better. Telling yourself you are a bad person is a self-defeating message to your inner self, but an ill person can get well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He presents this new, simple, and enlightened treatment for anger in easy to follow language. Ultimately these conclusions are illustrated as a set of simple diagrams that outline the full path of angers development starting from the core emotion of pain from early losses through raging behavior that is life damaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the revolutionary model of anger as an addiction, he demonstrates that anger can be healed. There is no need to rationally manage toxic anger (while remaining a bad person). Toxic anger practically evaporates as an emotional impulse as the underlying pain is resolved in the good, but ill person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included: Research survey paper on Anger Management classes by Desiree Harris, M. C.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: the world is constantly changing and we as human beings are constantly changing with it. It&amp;rsquo;s not the same world it was thirty years ago-nor should it be, and understanding this life is a fundamental part of making the most out of it and being the best people we can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing, Making It Happen: A Practical Guide for Killing It In the 21st Century. This guide explores and exposes some hard hitting truths about the world we live in, questioning the many things we think may be &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; along the way. The reality is, as a society we tend to bend towards conformity and often times we forget to reflect on where we are going or how we are progressing as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the goal of mapping success, growth, personal and mental health, and our unique relationships with escape, people, substance, wellness, and ambition, this guide breaks down the key elements of how we live our lives and how we can always aim higher. Take the time to look critically and pragmatically at your life and find out how you can start Making It Happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Farm - Wendell Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Larkspur Press (the 40+ year-old artisanal book maker based in Monterey KY) originally produced a limited run of Wendell Berry&#39;s illustrated poem, &lt;i&gt;The Farm&lt;/i&gt;, in 1995. With this new offset printed edition from Counterpoint Press, we have reproduced that gorgeous work in a lovely, understated gift package
&lt;li&gt;Larkspur Press was recently featured on NPR&#39;s All Things Considered (Nov 2017) and in &lt;i&gt;Garden and Gun&lt;/i&gt;magazine. Collectors know and love the press, and their edition of &lt;i&gt;The Farm&lt;/i&gt; has been OP for many years
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Farm&lt;/i&gt;  is one of several works Counterpoint Press is publishing and distributing widely for the first time in the United States
&lt;li&gt;The perfect gift for the stalwart Wendell Berry fan, as well as for readers who love poets as varied as Mary Oliver, Frank O&#39;Hara or Rumi
&lt;li&gt;Published as part of Counterpoint&#39;s commitment to ensuring Wendell Berry continues to be regarded as one of the most important voices of American letters, and to introducing his body of work to a new generation of readers" />

  <title>Suffering - a Biblical Study - Charles P. Arnold Jr. Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arnold brings to the delicate subject of suffering a model which partitions it into four classes. Each is defined by the faith and obedience of the individual and whether the suffering is the result of the sufferer or of forces external to the sufferer. Scripture alone is used as the sole basis for this model. Arnold also introduces a theology of Synergy based upon a translation of the Greek text of Romans 8.28 from ancient manuscripts. This theology is used to explain how God uses the suffering of the Christian to bring about good within the universal church. Still another of the many novel explanations in this book, which should aid the reader&#39;s understanding of suffering is the author&#39;s use of the python spirit. Taken from the book of Acts the reader finds herein how temptation was introduced into the Garden which brought about the Fall of Mankind. Besides all the new ways of thinking about suffering packed into these few pages Arnold also provides ideas on how one may manage their suffering through prayer, meditation, and community. This sensitive topic is supported throughout with verses from Scripture. Everyone who suffers will find strength and encouragement in God&#39;s word as explained in Suffering  A Biblical Study." />

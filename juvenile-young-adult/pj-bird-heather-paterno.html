  <title>Pj Bird - Heather Paterno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;PJ is a bluebird who spends his days helping his family and friends, playing chase with his brother, Jack, and visiting neighbors. But one day when PJs curiosity leads him to a neighbors house, he soon learns that life is meant to be experienced beyond his parents nest. Still, he cannot help but think the future seems a little scary without his parents by his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the guidance of a wise chickadee, PJ soon realizes he already has the tools to live on his own. He can fly; he can forage for food; and he even has the skills to build a nest. The only thing he needs now is an ideal mate. But what he does not realize is that she may be right under his very own beak!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful childrens tale, a little bluebird sets out on a coming-of-age journey where he must prepare to leave his parents nest and begin his grown-up life, with help from a wise chickadee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portion of the books proceeds will benefit the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;" />

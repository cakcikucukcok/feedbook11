  <title>Brim - E. Jerry Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tom Brim, decorated Marine and Korean War veteran, faces his biggest challenge as a Miami-Dade police sergeant. A sword and hatchet carrying maniac has killed his partner and threatens to kill Brim and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief of police places security patrols at the homes of Brim&#39;s parents and fiance&#39;, while Brim patrols Miami neighborhoods looking for the killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the police department is assigned to work with Brim to implement a sting operation that puts Brim face to face with the supposed killer. It culminates in a shootout that the police department has not seen on Miami streets since Prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal investigators learn that the hatchet man is the leader of an international drug cartel known as T95Y, a gang that stretches from South America to Mexico, Cuba, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international investigative team uncovers a plot that the intent of the gang is to deliver hundreds of tons of drugs to drop off points along both US coasts. A drug bust plan by the FBI and military is prepared to stop the delivery of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatchet Man and his gang are represented by a famous Miami defense lawyer Sam Brighton. Brim watches Brighton closely, completes his college degree in Miami, and enters law school, pursuing a second career as a prosecuting attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events collide leading to an action-packed conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

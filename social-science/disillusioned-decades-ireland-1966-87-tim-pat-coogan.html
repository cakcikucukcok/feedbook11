  <title>Disillusioned Decades – Ireland 1966–87 - Tim Pat Coogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Se&amp;aacute;n Lemass to mass unemployment: Ireland changed between 1966 and 1987 and, Tim Pat Coogan argues in &lt;i&gt;Disillusioned Decades&lt;/i&gt;, not for the better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year 1966 was one in which to take stock: fifty years since the Rising, what had the Republic achieved? In &lt;i&gt;Disillusioned Decades&lt;/i&gt;, Ireland’s most celebrated and controversial historian Tim Pat Coogan looks at a country in bloom &amp;ndash; Se&amp;aacute;n Lemass was at the end of a successful term as Taoiseach, the economy appeared stable and the newly founded Raid&amp;iacute;o Telif&amp;iacute;s &amp;Eacute;ireann was providing homes around Ireland with art and culture through their television screens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next 21 years, every aspect of Irish life was changed dramatically and profoundly. By 1987, Ireland was a country characterised by high levels of urbanisation, chronic unemployment, mass emigration and a heroin problem comparable in percentage terms to New York. What happened in those pivotal 20 years? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, famous for his perceptiveness and sharp observations, was editor of national newspaper &lt;i&gt;The Irish Press&lt;/i&gt; for most of this period, reporting on the people and events that &lt;i&gt;Disillusioned Decades&lt;/i&gt; analyses. Using his in-depth knowledge of the political, cultural and social changes of the 1960s, 70s and 80s rounded out with his personal reminiscences, in &lt;i&gt;Disillusioned Decades&lt;/i&gt; Coogan steps back to view the events in a wider context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout &lt;i&gt;Disillusioned Decades&lt;/i&gt;, Coogan paints a grim and no-punches-pulled picture of Ireland’s trajectory from 1966 to 1987. Sharply perceptive and enlivened by frequent flashes of personal reminiscence, this book presents a wealth of information and opinion in Coogan’s distinctive and authoritative style.&lt;/p&gt;" />

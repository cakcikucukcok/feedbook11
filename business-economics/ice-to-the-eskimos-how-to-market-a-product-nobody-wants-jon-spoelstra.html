What everyone else had seen as a lost cause, Spoelstra saw as an outstanding opportunity to reawaken a tired and beaten product to achieve unprecedented profitability.&lt;p&gt;Not just for sports marketers, this lively, entertaining book successfully makes the jump from sports to whatever your product may be. The techniques Spoelstra perfected while working for teams in the NHL and NBA&amp;#8212;from innovative packaging to image overhaul&amp;#8212;apply to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; product in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; company.

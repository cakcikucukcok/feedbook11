  <title>Unconditional Love - Dr. Gene W. Laramy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Laramy has spent over 40 years in the parish ministry before retiring. Upon looking back at his schooling: B.A. degree in psychology: M.Div. degree from seminary, majoring in psychology; DMln degree in psychology and pastoral counseling) he feels that he has learned as much about God&#39;s Unconditional Love through the seven dogs he and his wife have owned as in all of his schooling and experiences. Dr. Laramy believes there is nowhere that God&#39;s Unconditional Love is expressed more than through God&#39;s reflection in a dog. Like Jesus&#39; short life on earth showed us the way to live our lives, a dog&#39;s short life continues that message for us. Dr. Laramy is appalled by the amount of cruelty that we as human beings bestow upon these wonderful and amazing animals, and it is criminal that over 9000 dogs are euthanized every day in Humane Society centers in the United States. He is hopeful that through the reading of this book people will begin to look at dogs in a different light and mindset. This book is what it&#39;s all about.&lt;/p&gt;" />

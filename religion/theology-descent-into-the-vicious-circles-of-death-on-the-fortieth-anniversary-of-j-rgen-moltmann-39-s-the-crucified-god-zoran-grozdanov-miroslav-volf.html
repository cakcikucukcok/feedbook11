  <title>Theology-Descent into the Vicious Circles of Death: On the Fortieth Anniversary of Jürgen Moltmann&#39;s The Crucified God - Zoran Grozdanov, Miroslav Volf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this succinct, inviting volume, four Balkan theologians probe their contextual ways with the theology of Jurgen Moltmann, whose classic The Crucified God influenced novel theological approaches around the globe, most recently the emerging postwar Christian theology in the Balkans. The authors engage with the prevailing culture of ethnic and religious exclusivism within their context and present us with a range of theologically pertinent issues resulting from a wider discussion on religion and politics. The book offers a fresh and provocative reading of Christian faith that pins its hopes on the person and work of the Crucified and sets the ground for possible contextual contribution of Balkan theology to a World Church. Following Moltmann&#39;s invitation to see the Cross, and the crucified Christ, as an inner criterion of all theology, this book sheds theological light on the situation in the Balkans. The Cross of that region can be described as a &quot;Cross of the crossroads,&quot; since different religions, ethnic and national communities, memories, and cultures have always been sources of profound contact but also of deep division and violence. On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of The Crucified God, this collection can be read as a continuation of Moltmann&#39;s theological project, which calls for a courageous descent into &quot;circles of death&quot;--places of spiritual and physical imprisonment, without false comforts and premature hopes." />

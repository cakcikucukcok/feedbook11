      <meta name="description" content="It is dark before dawn. One definition of dawn is the first appearance of
light in the sky before sunrise. Another definition is the beginning of a
phenomenon or period of time, especially one considered favorable. To the
readers of this book you have already been introduced to the darker side of
life by an author who not only lived, written, and interpreted the darker
side of life. But one who fully understands that the darker side of life is right
before dawn. I ask you to read and absorb the words he has written. For
these words will illustrate vividly the transition from dark to light. Please
be prepared to see the light in the sky before sunrise. Please be prepared for
the beginning of a phenomenon especially favorable about to overtake and
disperse the dark forces in your life and those around you. Right now as he
walks down humbling path towards the horizon were the sun rises.
I DARE YOU TO WALK WITH HIM! HE IS THE GHOST!" />

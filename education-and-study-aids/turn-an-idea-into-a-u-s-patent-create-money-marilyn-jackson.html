  <title>Turn an Idea into a U.S. Patent/Create Money - Marilyn Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will help make it easier for the readers to know how to take their idea or ideas and turn them into money. This is an easy one-two-three-go-to book for entrepreneurs who want an easy starting point and an outcome that will end in prosperity.
The patent application is the very first thing that has to be done when applying for a United States patent. The application has to be filed through a patent attorney for legalization of your idea.
Register DBA (Doing Business As/name of business)
Cost a small amount, register at your court house
Tax ID number; Tax access office
Create money: Go to www.accountreceivable.com. 
Start the application and product to deliver to customers.
Once the product has been delivered, the invoice is signed and funding is approved. Most receivable companys fund is 80 percent of the total. One to two percent interest fee paid to the funding company. And the other 18 percent will be deposited into your bank account after the retailer has paid back the full receivable amount.
Example: $100k (products value)
Products delivered on 11-22-2016
Within 2448 hours, $80k is deposited into your business account.
Customers buy the product for a higher amount.
Half goes to the receivable funding company.
The other half, profit stays with the wholesale buyer.
Thirty-day term to pay back in full (12-22-2016).
When starting a new product development, you need to know all of the good, bad, and the ugly.
A. Good things can happen if you follow this book and put action along with lots of courage. It is very important to hire a patent attorney to help keep your ideas confidential. Always have a confidential form handy when revealing your idea. Have them sign and date the form for secret keeping. Never reveal you idea to anyone, unless theyve signed and dated the confidential form. It is very important.
B. The bad news is if you dont get the confidential form signed, you could lose all rights to your idea. Its about first come first served.
The ugly is having big backlash that requires fighting in court, if this idea was an original idea that you create. 
Some have created a poor mans patent. Thats when you print all the information about your product or service and mail it back to yourself through the USPS." />

  <title>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects - Mary Wollstonecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), written by the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should receive a rational education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be &amp;quot;companions&amp;quot; to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Wollstonecraft (27 April 1759 &amp;ndash; 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women&amp;#39;s rights. Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft&amp;#39;s life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships, received more attention than her writing. Today, Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences." />

  <title>My Math Monster - E.M. Olson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People will tell you that there are no such things as monsters. But if you ask Alexander Applebee, hell tell you another story. He has a math monster, and that monster can be very distracting when its time to do math. Alex tries telling his math teacher, his mother, and even his grandfather about the blue-eyed monster whose antics make it hard to concentrate on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex is flabbergasted that no one can see or hear the math monster, and they just dont understand his problem. Hes a bit relieved when he discovers other children have their own monsters. Though this makes him feel a little better, he must figure out how to deal with his own monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this picture book for children, Alexs unexpected adventure with his math monster reminds us that success in life is often a matter of taming our own creatures.&lt;/p&gt;" />

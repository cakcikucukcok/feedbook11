  <title>Escape from Athabasca - Rodrick Rajive Lal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Escape from Athabasca: A Collection of Short Stories and Poems deals with a wide range of themes taken from everyday life. The book describes life as a complex mix of the mundane and the extraordinary. Would it be a big surprise to hear about how someone who has never flown a plane before managing to fly one with great success? While some of the stories and poems in the book deal with domestic issues, others highlight the importance of friendship, risks and dangers in space travel, or even the impact of virtual game shows on young people. Just because we live secure lives far away from conflict zones, it doesnt mean we are shielded from the possibility of a nuclear war. The poems in this book provide a poetical rendition of a world that is sometimes offset by bereavement and, at other times, the comicality of a roadside barber trimming and shaving the hair of his clients, unperturbed by a disturbed world that rushes by." />

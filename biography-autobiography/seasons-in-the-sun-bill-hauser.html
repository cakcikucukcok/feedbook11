  <title>Seasons in the Sun - Bill Hauser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasons in the Sun&lt;/strong&gt; is the memoir of a college student/athlete in the mid-1970&#39;s. Bill Hauser played quarterback at Ohio&#39;s Wittenberg University, one of the top small-college football teams in America, and for one of the most successful coaches in the game. This book takes the reader through the ups and downs of competition and the life-lessons learned from that experience.&lt;p&gt;But it is not all about football. The author&#39;s enjoyment of music of the period is woven throughout the book with popular songs of the time serving as chapter titles.&lt;p&gt;If you remember the 1970&#39;s  the music, the events of the time and the college experience  you should enjoy this book. If you are a fan of college football, particularly small-college football, you likely will enjoy the intimate look at what the game was like in the 70s.&lt;p&gt;Younger readers might also find the contrast in student life today and back in the 70s interesting and amusing. And the lessons learned and training received on the gridiron are as relevant in the present as they were back then.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Deceased Thoughts from a Living Mind - Eli L Riché</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written over the course of three years, &quot;Deceased Thoughts From A Living Mind,&quot; is a poetic journey through out the dark and complex mind of Eli Rich. More than just relying on other people and their experiences, most of these poems come straight from his own head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;There comes a time when we, as human beings, must realize that life has more to offer than joy and pain. It has words and legacies that need to be expressed and fulfilled. Life gives us sensations and complexities that wash over our soul like energy untouched. I feel like it&#39;s my goal, my job, my desire to share these energies with you. I want you to be able to touch them with tongue, with mind and with spirit.&quot;&lt;br&gt;" />

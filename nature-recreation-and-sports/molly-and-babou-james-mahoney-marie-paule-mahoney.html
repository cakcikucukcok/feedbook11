  <title>Molly and Babou - James Mahoney, Marie-Paule Mahoney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A tango between fiction and non-fiction, this story will transport you on a wonderful journey through the hidden world of animals and their strong emotions.
How could Molly and Babou, with seemingly little in common, develop a deep understanding and friendship? Blind in one eye, poor-sighted in the other, Molly, a runt puppy born under the foundations of a tiny wooden house in Jamaica, is sensitive, intelligent, if a little spoilt. Babou, a real black bear, comes by Mollys house, as his world is crumbling around him with the relentless destruction of the New York forest. On the surface, he appears to be slow in thought, yet Molly comes to realize that he is a King in hiding in his often-harsh environment.
Molly and Babou roam the forest together, encountering other animals on the way. Molly decides that no one, including her adopted sisters, Rags and Pupsie, should find out about their friendship. She is devastated when Babou leaves her to go north to hibernate.
What will happen to the strong bond which has grown between the two of them when Babou returns from hibernation in the early spring with a sick, orphaned cub asking for Mollys help?" />

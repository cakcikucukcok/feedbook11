The exercises include clear step-by-step instruction and numerous example poems, including work by Lucille Clifton, Li-Young Lee, Cleopatra Mathis, Ezra Pound, Kenneth Rexroth, Patricia Smith, William Carlos Williams, and others.

Like its predecessor, WINGBEATS II will be a standard in creative writing classes, a standard go-to in every poet&amp;#39;s library." />

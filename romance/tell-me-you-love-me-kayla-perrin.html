  <title>Tell Me You Love Me - Kayla Perrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Sheldon Ford walked into her life, Tyanna Montgomery thought she had been carried up to heaven on the strong wings of a sexy black angel. But when he disappeared, she came crashing down to earth. Now he&#39;s back with some wild tale about having been undercover to take down a Miami mob-boss -- which means he&#39;s either big trouble or flat-out crazy, and either way Tyanna should let him go. But &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; if the man doesn&#39;t still make her heart race and her body ache with wanting him!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheldon should never have returned -- and now he&#39;s put his sweet woman in serious danger! But living without Tyanna&#39;s loving would not be living. Though she doesn&#39;t believe a word of his story, that doesn&#39;t make the threat less real -- and he&#39;ll protect his ebony queen to his last breath. But will she still want him when she realizes that taking a chance on this love means risking a lot more than her heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />

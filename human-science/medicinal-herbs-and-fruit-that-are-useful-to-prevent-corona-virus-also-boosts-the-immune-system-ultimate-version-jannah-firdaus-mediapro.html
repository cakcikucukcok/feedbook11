&lt;br /&gt;
A healthy immune system reduces your chance of viral infection and flu. With these natural ways to boost the immune system, you can achieve a healthy immune system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the Flu or viral season, many of your mates might get sick but some would stand tall even when everyone in their home is sick with the flu. Have you ever wondered, how some people get sick very often and some are more prone to catching cold or viral infection? It&amp;rsquo;s all about the body&amp;rsquo;s immune system. The immune system is the first line of defense of our body against an alien microorganism entering the body. Stronger your immune system, lesser would be the chance of you falling ill. But then again, having a strong immune system doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you invincible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With little change in your diet and routine, you can ensure that your immune system is strong enough to protect you against the virus infection. From sleeping for 8 hours to walking in the sun to eating a balanced diet, the ways are simple but they can really be helpful if followed. Follow them and witness the change in your body&amp;rsquo;s strength to fight illness. Vegetables, fruits, seeds and nuts are loaded with nutrients that are essential for our immune system. Consuming them on a daily basis boosts the immunity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feeding your body certain foods may help keep your immune system strong. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for ways to prevent winter colds, corona virus attack and the flu, your first step should be a visit to your local grocery store. Plan your meals to include these powerful immune system boosters." />

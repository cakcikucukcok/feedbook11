  <title>Echoes from the Valley - Vinay Capila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three friends, fresh out of school in Srinagar, decide to go for a trek into the mountains. On their journey they hear whispers about armed strangers sneaking through the mountain passes into the Kashmir valley. Little do they know that the whispers will soon convert into roars that will engulf their lives: for these are the strands of the elaborate web of intrigue being woven across the border.
All too soon tremours are felt in their homes and it becomes clear that a plot is afoot for the ethnic cleansing of the valley by the invading terrorists and their local supporters. the ultimate exodus of the minority communities leaves a bitter taste of guilt and impotence among those of the majority community who have watched it all happen helplessly.
till one family decides that they will not watch with apathy while their lives are dictated by  alien forces. They begin a campaign to try and convert the silent majority into a dynamic force that will restore the intrinsic culture that has been the unique feature of their valley. Will they succeed?" />

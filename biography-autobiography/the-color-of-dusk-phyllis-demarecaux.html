&lt;p&gt;Leaving behind the fallout from a second divorce, she moved to Paris,where she began writing childrens stories, working for the publishing house Hachette, and ultimately giving birth to her son, Sean. In 1980 she met her future husband, the screenwriter and film producer Robert Joseph. Phyllis worked alongside her husband in the film industry until his death in 2002. From humble beginnings to Hollywood, Phyllis Demarecaux has woven a fascinating story that traces the arc of her long, colorful life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

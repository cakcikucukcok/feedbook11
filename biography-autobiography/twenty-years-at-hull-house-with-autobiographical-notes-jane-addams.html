  <title>Twenty Years at Hull House; with Autobiographical Notes - Jane Addams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Major work from the American social worker, sociologist, philosopher and reformer, known in America as the &amp;quot;mother of social work.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first part of this book is simply beautiful. In it Addams provides a strange and insightful look at what it was like to grow up the daughter of a well-off miller in rural Cedarville, Illinois in the 19th century. Surprisingly for a Victorian-era social reformer, she&amp;#39;s eminently relatable and self-reflective. She describes in detail things like a nightmare she had as a young girl where everyone in the world was dead except her, and the world depended upon her solitary work as a blacksmith to start it up again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She is able to recognize in this the early delusions of grandeur so common to children, and a sense of her own impotence she carried into the women&amp;#39;s seminary and beyond. She discusses how her later educational tours of Europe furthered her charitable and democratic sensibilities (along with her hope for a non-religious &amp;quot;cathedral of humanity&amp;quot; to unite all mankind), and yet she also realizes that this excessive education was only part of what Tolstoy called &amp;quot;the snare of preparation,&amp;quot; that chilling sense that infinite training only impedes real life and action. Addams saw that she (and the other over-educated and underemployed women of her generation) needed real vigorous action, especially in public life, to feel like worthwhile members of society. So, she starts the Hull Street Settlement House.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

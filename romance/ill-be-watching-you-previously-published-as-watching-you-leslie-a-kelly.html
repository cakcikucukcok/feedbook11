  <title>Ill Be Watching You (previously published as Watching You) - Leslie A. Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In the first book of a thrilling new romantic suspense trilogy, &lt;/i&gt;USA Today&lt;i&gt; bestselling author Leslie A. Kelly shows just how hot - and how dangerous - Hollywood can be.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the shadows, someone is always watching&lt;br&gt;  Aspiring screenwriter Jessica Jensen grew up on movies starring heartthrob Reece Winchester, the eldest brother of a Hollywood dynasty. She never thought she&#39;d meet the man in person, though. Actor, director, millionaire, and gorgeous mystery man--he&#39;s every woman&#39;s fantasy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Reece wants Jessica the moment he sees her, and he&#39;s a man who always gets what he wants. At first he was only after a night in her bed, but as he comes to know the smart, confident woman beneath the stunning exterior, he realizes once will never be enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Unfortunately, Jessica&#39;s real-life Cinderella story is about to take a deadly turn... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Reece&#39;s world is filled with fierce ambition and dark family secrets the Winchesters desperately want to hide. But he and his brothers aren&#39;t the only ones who know those secrets. Someone else is out there, waiting to strike. Waiting-and always watching. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When danger finally steps out of the shadows, Reece will have to face his past. And Jessica will have to decide just how far she can trust the man she loves with her heart...and her life.&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Kelly hits all the right notes here and balances the romance with suspense to very nice effect, making this a must read for readers who like a bit of danger with their love story. Recommended.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;The romance between this pair was hot and exciting, but it was the ending that I really liked because it had me on the edge-of-my-seat. ...I would recommend &lt;i&gt;Watching You&lt;/i&gt; by Leslie A. Kelly, if you enjoy romantic suspense, the opposites attract trope, or books by authors Susan Stoker, Cora Brent, Kaylea Cross and Laura Kaye.&quot; -- Harlequin Junkie" />

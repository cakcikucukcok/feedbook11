  <title>Painful Choices - Margy New</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abby Norris adjusts quickly to the college environment and develops a close friendship with her roommate, Ruth.  What she does not expect is to fall in love with Jake Murphy.  The two are from completely different socio-economic backgrounds, and a self-assured Jake has met his match in Abby.  Combine a hilariously funny Thanksgiving weekend, a tender Valentine&#39;s Day, and a rambunctious touch-football game with passion and you will delight in this book.  The couple&#39;s relationship deepens to an emotional and physical level that neither had anticipated.  But constant conflicts test their love beginning with a serious cattle disease, numerous separations, substance abuse, a life-threatening automobile accident, and infidelity.
     Soon after they marry, Jake and Abby face more tragedy when their newborn son dies.  They are ill equipped to deal with their sorrow and are unable to be of comfort to one another.  Jake buries himself in farm business and Abby seeks solace in the arms of an old acquaintance.
     Just when life begins to seem normal, cancer rears its ugly head and death again enters their lives.  A life-threatening pregnancy drives a wedge between the two when Abby refuses the doctor recommendation to end the pregnancy.  A Painful Choice.
      Wealth and power aren&#39;t enough to sustain them as they work to restore the close personal ties with friends and reclaim the lost passion  and love they once shared.  Painful Choices have cost them dearly." />

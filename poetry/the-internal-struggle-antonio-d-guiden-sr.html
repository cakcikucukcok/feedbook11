  <title>The Internal Struggle - Antonio D. Guiden Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its amazing how we take the little things in life for granted;
being able to walk, to see, to hear, and to talk.
Some people are not able to do one or a multiple combinations of these
things. And what do we do with these basic but blessed abilities;
turn a blind eye to the things we dont want to believe,
not give a second thought to listen to what others have to say in their
defense but invite in the negative tongue that speaks on another to
diminish ones character.
Why?
Why is it that in this society we are so quick to believe or fall into that
negative influence
instead of standing tall and finding out for ourselves before we lash out
and slander our own tongue on a word that may not have any value of
truth behind it?
A persons character should always be put into consideration before
even opening your mind to allow such words to be
spoken from their lips.
Its time to step aside and throw away all the nonsense
everyone is so eager to feed off of.
I refuse to try to sway another into feeling a certain way about another,
I let the facts speak for themselves.
Im done feeding off the nonsense and baring a false tongue.
Its time to stand up and grow out of these habits.
I know some people are so stuck in their ways that they dont see any
room for change
or believe anything they do isnt wrong but
there is this essence of karma we all know that will forever be in their
midst. There is only a few who will own up to changing
and without this change,
the only thing left for us to do is destroy one another." />

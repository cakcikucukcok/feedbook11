  <title>Milo March #1 - Kendell Foster Crossen, M.E. Chaber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Milo March, a tough private eye from Denver, is sent to Aragon City (which&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;be Hollywood) to help the City Betterment Committee wipe out the gangsters and hoodlums controlling brothels, bookies, gamblers, shady nightclubs, and the dope traffic. He just has to uncover &amp;ldquo;Mr. X,&amp;rdquo; the mystery man who&amp;rsquo;s been raking in a tidy little income by providing protection to the Syndicate. But can Milo accomplish that without stumbling over something even more dangerous&amp;mdash;like who pays Mr. X, and why?&amp;nbsp;Milo is well equipped for the job. He has plenty of gall, good looks, an unlimited expense account, a fishtail Cadillac, and ample experience with lawbreakers&amp;mdash;and beautiful, willing women, of whom there are several, but only one who is the girl next door. As March starts his snooping, he is surprised to discover a sexy, naked blonde in his hotel room. And there are other, more painful things complicating his life&amp;mdash;things like beatings and fistfights and gun battles, and a blow he never saw coming.&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;ldquo;It was obvious that sooner or later there&amp;rsquo;d be a capable challenger of Mickey Spillane in the concoction of the muscular and seductive mixture that makes Spillane&amp;rsquo;s best-selling books.

  <title>A World Away - Andrea Leaphart Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The  world is rapidly changing---and not always for the best.  Do you ever want to leave this world and wonder if there is a better place in our galaxy?  Would it really be better?  How would you get there?  Well, run with Realynn through her story of events, and shell show you the WAY!
After Realynns parents are killed, she goes to live with her aunt Ananine, who is a little weird and mysterious.  Aunt Ananine is a naturalist, who dabs into a lot of medicinal concoctions. One day, aunt Ananine answers a knock at the door which  leads to her  disappearance.  The abductor leaves behind a message that threatens  Realynns life and  the time of its return.  Petrified,  Realynn searches the house for clues.  She finds none and in her frustration, she falls into a deep sleep.  In her dream, she receives clues to help her. Following the instructions  in her dream, Realynns journey begins. In her quest to find her aunt and to save herself,  she is led to many strange places-- worlds away from her own.  In the end, she gains possession of several valuable keys, but will they be worth keeping?" />

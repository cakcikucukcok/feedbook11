  <title>A Duke in Shining Armor - Loretta Chase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not all dukes are created equal. Most are upstanding members of Society. And then there&amp;#8217;s the trio known as Their Dis-Graces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugh Philemon Ancaster, seventh Duke of Ripley, will never win prizes for virtue. But even he draws the line at running off with his best friend&amp;#8217;s bride. All he&amp;#8217;s trying to do is recapture the slightly inebriated Lady Olympia Hightower and return her to her intended bridegroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reasons that elude her, bookish, bespectacled Olympia is supposed to marry a gorgeous rake of a duke. The &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; is flabbergasted. Her family&amp;#8217;s ecstatic. And Olympia? She&amp;#8217;s climbing out of a window, bent on a getaway. But tall, dark, and exasperating Ripley is hot on her trail, determined to bring her back to his friend. For once, the world-famous hellion is trying to do the honorable thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why does Olympia have to make it so deliciously difficult for him . . . ?&lt;/p&gt;" />

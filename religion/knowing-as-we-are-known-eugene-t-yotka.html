  <title>Knowing as We Are Known - Eugene T. Yotka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Immerse yourself in that still place within, in which God speaks to the true self that you have been created to be. This book is more than simply information about inner stillness; it is a guide into the experience of inner stillness itself. This is the authors journey to that place where God speaks to our spirits and calls us children. This is a call not so much to do something as much as it is a call to be who God created us to be. Through the experiences of contemplation, waiting, hope, and assurance, it is the goal of this writing that you will find rest for your soul, body, and mind in a fresh, new, and enduring way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all long to live from the center of an authentic self. Gene Yotka has provided an important resource for helping us identify and express a spiritual life from that center. His book is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;
-Dr. Steve Harper, Professor of Spiritual Formation, Asbury Theological Seminary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene has demystified contemplative prayer and made it accessible to the average believer.&lt;br /&gt;

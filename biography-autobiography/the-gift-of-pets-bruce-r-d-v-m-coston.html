  <title>The Gift of Pets - Bruce R. D.V.M. Coston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bruce R. Coston&#39;s first book, &lt;i&gt;Ask the Animals,&lt;/i&gt; earned him high praise for being another James Herriot. Now, in his delightful second memoir, Coston shares more rich stories about his animal patients and the clients who make veterinary practice so fulfilling. In this humorous, poignant, and enthralling collection, Coston explores what it is about the interaction with our pets that provides such profound companionship, and how a love for animals helps us to be more fully human. This ability to enrich and fulfill us is the Gift of pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coston&#39;s characters, both the people and the animals, will engage you from the first page. You&#39;ll meet Mr. Johnston, the linguist, and his Mountain of Love; Rachel, the office prankster; Coston&#39;s &quot;girlfriend,&quot; Megan; and Mischief, the only patient Coston has ever had that helped to pay for her own surgery. You&#39;ll learn what a &quot;sugar glider&quot; is and how to give one mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. You&#39;ll marvel at Lisa, Coston&#39;s first veterinary technician, and the courage that the Gift of pets gave her to reinvent herself and rekindle the dreams she thought she had squandered.&lt;i&gt;The Gift of Pets&lt;/i&gt; celebrates what it&#39;s like to be truly blessed with a deep love and concern for the pets with which we surround ourselves. Coston invites all animal lovers to rejoice in that Gift with him in this inspiring book of true stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />

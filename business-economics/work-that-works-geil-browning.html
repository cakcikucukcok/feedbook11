  <title>Work That Works - Geil Browning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Use cognitive diversity to your advantage and transform your organization&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Work That Works&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to building better teams and an exceedingly positive workplace culture. Based on the tools and principles of Emergenetics, this book helps you improve communication, connection, and performance through an enlightening process of self-discovery and sharing. You&#39;ll discover the unique combination of strengths you bring to the table, and understand the power of your Thinking and Behavioral Preferences to gain greater clarity and a better understanding of your skills, habits and behavior. As people understand and share their Profiles, the real magic happens—teams can be built synergistically, and team members can collaborate more effectively by &quot;borrowing another person&#39;s brain.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Cognitive diversity is a given whenever a group of people work together toward a common goal; the critical factor is whether those differences become an obstacle or a catalyst. By bringing each person&#39;s &quot;true self&quot; to light, you provide a window through visible elements of diversity and shine a light on their gifts—and it&#39;s only then that those gifts can be leveraged to their utmost capacity. &lt;p&gt;Dr. Geil Browning&#39;s second book outlines this process of discovery, effective communication, using thoughtful language, addressing challenges and instituting long-term behavioral change. By honoring the Preferences and Attributes of all employees, you lay the groundwork for enhanced performance and engagement. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how changing your language changes your thought patterns, and eventually leads to changes in behavior&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dig into the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; differences between you and your co-workers at the cognitive and behavioral levels&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover the strengths each person brings to the table, and synergize those strengths to collaborate more effectively&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how to apply these same principles to social activities and family life to improve all communications and connections&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Work That Works&lt;/i&gt; provides a blueprint for the transformation, and the practical guidance you need to build a better organization." />

  <title>May Day - Linda Schiro-Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone sixteen years or older will enjoy the true experiences of a young girl left to fend for herself in a big city. Her father has told her she is wet behind the ears, but her belief in herself is nonstop. &lt;br&gt;
If you are interested in boats, this is an opportunity to learn how three generations of the authors family went from a toy boat to a yacht, giving detailed specifications and history. The author shows her bravery and determination to save the day when she swims under water to rescue the family boat. &lt;br&gt;
A volunteer fire department becomes the social center of the community while putting out fires. Coffee has to be served at one dangerous fire in the middle of the night, and things get hot. &lt;br&gt;
The author stops in the middle of the match point in a tennis game to analyze it. She and her partner are blood sisters, and no one better mess with them. &lt;br&gt;
The author shows you how to bargain her way or no way when she travels through Morocco, buying souvenirs. After a nerve-wracking hike to the Sun Gate at Machu Picchu, she loses her group when she goes to the toilet. &lt;br&gt;
Living at a dorm while attending secretarial school and trying to stay alive in the big City of Chicago becomes an unmanageable feat, the dorm turns out to be the cottage of the well-known Schwinn bicycle family from the turn of the century, and the floor mates are just as interesting. &lt;br&gt;
The book will pique your interest when the author describes the layout and design of a top law firm in Chicago. An associate attorney challenges his legal secretary with his dictation of a legal brief detailing nudity. &lt;br&gt;
You will get a peek into the classrooms of a Catholic Elementary School housed in a convent. The drama and tactics of one nun in particular will taunt the author, and then two other nuns will restore her heart with wonderful feelings. &lt;br&gt;
In May Day, there is jealousy and sabotage, love and marriage, death, and lots of tears, and you wont want to miss the Hawaiian Luau given by the fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, or is it a toga party?" />

  <title>Santa&#39;s Husband - Daniel Kibblesmith, A P. Quach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Offering a fresh twist on Kris Kringle, a clever yet heartfelt book that tells the story of a black Santa, his white husband, and their life in the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that Santa Claus is jolly, but in &lt;em&gt;Santa&amp;#8217;s Husband&lt;/em&gt;, this cherished symbol of the holiday season is also black and gay, and married to an equally cheery man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this witty and sweet illustrated Christmas tale, humor writer Daniel Kibblesmith introduces us to Mr. and Mr. Claus, and gives us a glimpse of their lives together. We see the Clauses sitting by the fire at their cozy North Pole home, vacationing at the beach, having an occasional disagreement, celebrating their wedding day, and comforting each other when some loudmouth people on television angrily dispute Santa&amp;#8217;s appearance and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the weeks before Christmas, Santa&amp;#8217;s husband helps with all the pre-Christmas work, from double-checking lists, to feeding the reindeer (organic gluten-free grains, of course), to negotiating labor disputes with the restive workshop elves. At the height of toy-making season, he even fills in for his busy hubby at the mall to ensure every child can meet the Big Guy in the red suit, and give him their wish list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this charming book reminds us, Santa Claus can come in all shapes and colors and sizes&amp;#8212;just like the children and families he visits all over the world each Christmas eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring beautiful watercolor pictures drawn by artist AP Quach, &lt;em&gt;Santa&amp;#8217;s Husband&lt;/em&gt; is a delightful gift for readers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />

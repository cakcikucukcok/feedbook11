  <title>Dr. Kaskel&#39;s Living In Wellness, Volume One: Let Food Be Thy Medicine - Larry Kaskel, M.D., Michael Kaskel, R.N.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if everything you thought you knew about nutrition for health and weight loss was wrong? What if doing the opposite of what you&#39;ve been taught actually made significant changes in your weight and health? Would you follow a way of eating that goes against conventional wisdom, focusing mainly on saturated fats, cholesterol and protein?   When patients question me on the efficacy of what they are about to embark upon, my response is simple and concise: it&#39;s all about the sugar. Even when supposedly &quot;healthy&quot; sugar that comes from &quot;healthy&quot; whole grains, oatmeal, yogurt and milk that you&#39;ve been consuming forever, it still has deleterious effects on your body. Besides the politics of why it&#39;s supposedly &quot;healthy&quot;, the reality is that when you cut those foods out of your diet and replace them with the foods that you&#39;ve been told not to eat, your weight and health will improve!" />

  <title>Retire Well: A Guide to What&#39;s Important in Retirement - Nii Boi-Dsane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A good driver pays attention to the condition of the road; is aware of potential obstacles and opportunities; and with deliberate care and attention, navigates his way safely home. The journey to retirement is no different, except YOU are your own driver.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than reaching retirement, having worked hard, feeling old and tired, with nothing to show for it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For most people, retirement conjures up images of rest, relaxation and general enjoyment of life after years of labour. For many, however, when the time comes, the reality is rather different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful and enjoyable retirement demands three pre-requisites: robust personal health, good financial planning and supportive relationships. After all, one does not retire into a vacuum, but into a social context. The quality of your social relationships is, therefore, crucial. But even more critical is the quality and state of your financial and personal wellbeing as you transition into this phase in your life. Retire Well will give you a clear, evidence-based approach towards preparing for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is aimed at those who are starting to think about retirement and presents relevant facts, analysis, opinions, and stories from the experience of others. You will be able to reflect on where you are now on your retirement journey, where you&amp;rsquo;d like to be when you retire, and the book will give you tools and encouragement to take the necessary purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;" />

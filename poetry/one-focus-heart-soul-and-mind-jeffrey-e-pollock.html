  <title>One Focus (Heart, Soul and Mind) - Jeffrey E. Pollock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christian poetry is a gift from God inspired by the Word of God andgiven to glorify Himself in His Son Jesus. In this mixed-up, self-centered world the Lord Jesus Christ taught his disciples that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6) -- the one hope to reach our Father in Heaven, the only reliable source of truth, the creator and sustainer of all life. Worship Him only!
Old Testament, Isaiah 55:11 tells the world Almighty God, Yahweh (the One who is, the unchanging God) is in total control, nothing and no one thwarts His plans! This Scripture passage says it so beautifully: As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth. It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. For example, Let there be light, and there was light. Genesis 1:3, NIV
New Testament elaborates, In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. He existed in the beginning with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him. The Word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it. John 1:1-5, NLT 
This collection of Christian poetry founded upon inerrant Holy Scripture was written to encourage believers in their faith and worship of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, the one and only mediator between God and man. This work of heart is a temporary tribute to His eternal grace and glory.
Hope you will enjoy!" />

in a coma from a car accident. Only to awake to a life that turns a
horrific turn. The death of his father. The snubbing of his family and
friends cursing him for what happened. A mad scientist wanting him dead as he progresses to take over the world.
All the while, haunted by Spirits of Fate try to keep his death from happening again. Reintroduced to a power to travel Interdimensional Gateways. Chosen as the next saviour of humanity, and follow a blind path to bring about Balance between Good and Evil.

  <title>A Time To Dream (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wanted: Prince Charming for damsel in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Melaine was in distress all right! But the last thing she wanted was prince - or any man for that matter - to come riding to her rescue. She&#39;d had it with the opposite sex she wanted only to disappear, to retreat to a peaceful haven to mend her broken heart. Until she met Luke Chalmers, whose sensual intrusion in her life was anything but peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His stolen kisses left her flustered, and his rakish grin sent her heart racing. But a disastrous engagement to a man who had deceived her left Melaine unwilling to trust another man, any man, so quickly. Especially one who left so many questions about himself unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

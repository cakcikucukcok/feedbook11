  <title>It Was Nothing! - Lewis Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story provides a gentle, light-hearted introduction of the naivety of youth, highlighting the potential of Mary Lewis to succeed in commerce and the determination of Alun Carpenter, who was destined to achieve much public good. 
The journey covers the period of 1944 to 2009 and gradually adopts a serious note, as indeed does the style of the author, who beguilingly unfolds the theme of love, aspirations, and selfless devotion, where the majority of driving forces tenderly radiate from the ladies of the tale. 
With originality of thought, the reader is taken along a winding roller-coaster ride of a fusion of emotions and prejudice, ranging from surprising humour to disappointment and grief. Rivalrythe potential for making enemiesgreed, and retribution become important threads, leading to a gripping insight into blackmail and four murders. The reader is left to discover who is brought to justice.
Alun Carpenter retires from the police service and is charged with murder. The evidence against him is conclusive, but what will happen to him and his family?
In the twisting account of the final chapter, all is revealed as to the identity of the persons who sought retribution against Carpenter and those who surprisingly assisted him. It concludes with the outcome of Marys apparent affaire and business enterprise.
Those who have read the story considered it to be a fascinating, totally absorbing, highly enjoyable experience; and their only disappointment was that it came to an end." />

  <title>Last Dance - David Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winston Patrick reluctantly leads some kids in suing their school when a same-sex partner is refused entry to the prom, but opponents will stop at nothing to make their point, not even murder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winston Patrick was a successful lawyer who defended the downtrodden of Vancouver’s criminal world. Dissatisfied with his career, he traded in the courtroom for the high school classroom. Winston is barely surviving his first year at a Vancouver high school when his students present a human rights issue. A student wants to bring his same-sex partner to the high school prom, but the school won’t let him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winston reluctantly leads his proteges on their first legal quest: suing the school. He never thought that fighting for a student’s rights could have deadly consequences, but as the issue gains publicity, Winston discovers that their opponents will stop at nothing to make their point  not even murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Russell’s first Winston Patrick novel, &lt;i&gt;Deadly Lessons&lt;/i&gt;, was shortlisted for an Arthur Ellis Award for best first crime novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />

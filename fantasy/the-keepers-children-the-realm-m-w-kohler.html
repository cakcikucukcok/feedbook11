  <title>The Keepers Children; the Realm - M. W. Kohler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For those who, for whatever reason, cannot accept, or for those who want, but have not yet found what they seek, I bring you a simple explanation. The Keepers Children: The Realm is the second book of the Valley series. It tells the tale, or truth if you can believe, of the growth of the ones who give the rightful magic of all the magical worlds, the value that is its due. In the first installment, you learned of Cory, who becomes the Keeper of the Plain. His wife, Sandra, who learns of her powers after coming to the Plain. Corys sister, Deidra and her husband Tom, who maintain the Valley. The four that were the beginning of the Rightful Magic. In this volume, you will learn of their children, who learn of life and the pleasures and pains that come with maturity and horrors of the Dark Forces they must battle!In this volume, you will also learn of Mike, who becomes the Overseer of the Realm and the young woman who becomes his wife, Gloreana. You will learn of Katie, Mikes biological twin, who becomes Mistress of Magic for the Domain of Dolaris. You will learn of Morgan and Megan, Mikes younger brother and sister and identical, except for gender, twins. You will also learn of Marie, Mikes cousin, who becomes Mistress of the North West Domain of Vistalin. There are others that are involved, but to meet them, you must venture into the concept that you do not know all that can be.&lt;/P&gt;" />

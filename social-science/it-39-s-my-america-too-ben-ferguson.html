  <title>It&#39;s My America Too - Ben Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;It&#39;s My America Too&lt;/em&gt;, Ben Ferguson, the voice of America&#39;s youth and the host of &lt;em&gt;The Ben Ferguson Show&lt;/em&gt;, one of the country&#39;s fastest-growing syndicated radio shows, delivers his views on all the issues, from politics to current affairs to popular culture. Everyone wants to know what Ferguson will say next&amp;#8212;and here&#39;s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Ferguson is a conservative who is also an independent thinker unafraid to take contrary positions. In &lt;em&gt;It&#39;s My America Too&lt;/em&gt;, the twenty-two-year-old media star shoots from the hip and the lip on numerous topics. Ferguson tells us why he thinks the voting age should be lowered to sixteen; who the &quot;New Minority&quot; is&amp;#8212;the twenty-something men and women who are overworked, underpaid, overmarketed, and drastically underrepresented; why politicians talk about and at young adults, but never to them; how he feels about everything from homeschooling to sex, NASCAR, and George W. Bush; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson&#39;s message is clear. He is not on a campaign to reform liberals and turn them into right-wing Republicans. He is presenting his views on American society and challenging those who do not agree with him to an open debate. Some will not agree with his political and religious views. What he hopes to accomplish, with both his radio show and this book, is to energize future generations about politics. The way to do this is through open communication. He is encouraging his generation (and even some in previous generations) to get involved and be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hip and forthright, funny yet never pedantic, Ferguson offers a fresh viewpoint and insights on topics such as &quot;What the Republican Party can learn from Bill Clinton&quot;; &quot;Why anti-Americanism is our problem&quot;; and &quot;Dubya: my favorite redneck.&quot; He reveals a positive outlook on the economy, offers his opinions on bias in the media, and also includes chapters on Donald Rumsfeld, affirmative action, and the values instilled in him by his mother and father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferguson&#39;s pride in his country, in his religious beliefs, and in his choices reflects his vision of the American dream. He is informed and determined to make a difference. Youthful as he is, he has a unique perspective not only on America and its history, but also on current events and issues. You may applaud his opinions or perhaps you will disagree with them. But for those of you who are angered by this book, Ferguson instructs: &quot;Don&#39;t just get mad. Do something about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />

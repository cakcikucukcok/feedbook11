  <title>The Perfect Paragon - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Perfect Paragon &lt;/i&gt;continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series--now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being nearly killed by both a hired hit man and her former secretary, Agatha Raisin could use some low-key cases. So when Robert Smedley walks through the door, determined to prove that his wife is cheating, Raisin Investigations immediately offers to help. Trouble is, Agatha hates divorce cases--especially when the client is as pompous as Smedley--but she has a business to run and she&#39;s not about to turn away a paying customer. Unfortunately for Agatha, Mabel Smedley appears to be the perfect wife, young and pretty and a regular volunteer at church. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Smedley&#39;s case doesn&#39;t look promising, Agatha&#39;s attentions are diverted when she stumbles across the body of missing teenager, Jessica Bradley. In a sudden gesture of kindness (and good public relations), Agatha offers to investigate Jessica&#39;s death free of charge. &lt;br&gt;As Agatha juggles her two biggest cases, things are turned upside down when Robert Smedley is found poisoned in his office. The prime suspect, his sainted wife Mabel, immediately hires Agatha to find the real killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of her old friend, Sir Charles Fraith, and some newly hired staff, Agatha Raisin sets off on another adventure solving crime in the English Cotswolds.&lt;/p&gt;" />

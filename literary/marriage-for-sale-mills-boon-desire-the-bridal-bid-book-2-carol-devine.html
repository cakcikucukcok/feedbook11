  <title>Marriage For Sale (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) (The Bridal Bid, Book 2) - Carol Devine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Bridal Bid:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Highest Bidder Wins the Bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;I BOUGHT A WIFE?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Montana rancher Linc Monroe knew that the backwater society called &quot;The Community&quot; practiced outdated customs, but he never expected them to put a 28-eight-year-old virgin on the auction block!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So the honorable cowboy had no choice but to buy – and wed – alluring Rachel Johnson in order to set her free. And then the reluctant groom had to educate his bride about city ways before she could live on her own. Trouble was, the spirited beauty took to ranching life as if she were born to it, and soon Linc&#39;s captivating pupil began teaching him a few lessons about matters of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

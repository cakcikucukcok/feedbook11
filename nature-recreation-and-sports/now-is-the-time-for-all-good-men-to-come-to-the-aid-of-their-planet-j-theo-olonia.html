In &lt;i&gt;Now is the Time for All Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Planet&lt;/i&gt;, author J. Theo Olonia discusses how, with awareness, we can weigh our actions for the consequences and impact they have on the environment and on life in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olonia shows that health and well-being in the future are affected by todays choices. He:&lt;/p&gt;
	presents a scientific view of the creation of the universe, describing the formation and evolution of the solar system;&lt;/br&gt;
	explains the evolution of our home world through four and a half billion years, including the evolution of humanity;&lt;/br&gt;
	describes how wild places are in serious decline and the adverse affect it has on indigenous wild life;&lt;/br&gt;
	addresses how we are controlled by our social order, which directly affects the choices we make with respect to the environment;&lt;/br&gt;
	discusses the modalities that helped turn his life around, making him more aware and conscious of every aspect of living;&lt;/br&gt;
	reviews some of the possible outcomes based on todays choices; an&lt;/br&gt; 
	offers a new concept of how to relate to Earth-Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now is the Time for All Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Planet&lt;/i&gt; communicates that how we relate today sets the historical course of being stewards of our world, taking what we need with awareness and gratitude, but also giving back to maintain a sustainable, viable world.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Tales of men and ghosts - Edith Wharton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tales of Men and Ghosts by Edith Wharton is a book composed of ten short stories: The Bolted Door, His Father&#39;s Son, The Daunt Diana, The Debt, Full Circle, The Legend, The Eyes, The Blond Beast, Afterward and The Letters. The &quot;ghost stories&quot; are more compelling, based on what Wharton called a well-written &quot;thermometric quality&quot; of a phantom; that is, his ability to &quot;[send] a shiver along the spine&quot;. These stories often depend on psychological intuition, as well as moral or social, for example, when Andrew Culwin realizes that the &quot;Eyes&quot; that persecute him are his. In &quot;Afterward&quot;, when Ned Boyne leaves his bride for the ghost of the business partner who betrayed her part of a mining fortune, Mary Boyne must realize the limitations of the marriage relationship that she had considered so idyllic.

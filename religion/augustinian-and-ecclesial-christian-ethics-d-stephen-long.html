  <title>Augustinian and Ecclesial Christian Ethics - D. Stephen Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the relationship between the command to love one&amp;rsquo;s enemies and the use of violence and/or other coercive political means? This work examines this question by comparing and contrasting two important contemporary approaches to Christian ethics, neoAugustinian and the ecclesial or neoAnabaptist. It traces the complicated conversation that has taken place since John Howard Yoder took on Reinhold Niebuhr&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the Anabaptists in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s. It consists of three parts. The first part traces the development of the Augustinian-Niebuhrian approach to ethics from Niebuhr through those who have advanced his work including Paul Ramsey, Timothy Jackson, Charles Mathewes, Eric Gregory, and Jennifer Herdt. It also examines the Augustinian ethics of Oliver O&amp;rsquo;Donovan, John Milbank and Nicholas Wolterstorff. Along with tracing the Augustinian approach and its trajectories through agapism, theology and the interpretation of Augustine, it identifies fifteen criticisms that this approach brings against the neoAnabaptists. The second part traces the origin of the ecclesial or neoAnabaptist approach, and then examines its relationship to, and criticism of, agapism, what theological doctrines are central and its interpretation of Augustine. Its purpose is primarily constructive by explaining the role that ecclesiology, Christology and eschatology have among the neoAnabaptists. The third part addresses the criticisms levied by Augustinians against the neoAnabaptists by drawing on the constructive theology in the second part. It intends to show where the Augustinian critics are correct, where they have missed key theological teachings, and where they misrepresent. It also assesses the summons to the nationalist project the Augustinians put to the neoAnabaptists. If this work is successful, this third part will not be defensive. It will instead illumine the reasons for the criticisms and suggest means by which the conversation that began between Yoder and Niebuhr can continue and possibly bear fruit for theological ethics in both its ecclesial and nationalist projects for generations to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

Stephen Long</i></b> | Managing to sustain a single well-construed argument throughout, D. Stephen Long defends an ecclesially-centered Augustinian politics against rival ways of appropriating Augustine for late modern political orders.<br /><b><i>Augustinian and Ecclesial Christian Ethics: On Loving Enemies</i></b> | Now, in Augustinian and Ecclesial Christian Ethics, Long takes up a related set of differences in Christian ethics, between “neo-Anabaptists” and “neo-Augustinians.” The “neo-Anabaptists” – or, as Long comes to refer to them, the “ecclesial” ethicists, are represented by John Howard Yoder, Stanley Hauerwas, James William McClendon, and others who have taken up their work.<br /><b><i>D. Stephen Long – Augustinian and Ecclesial Christian ...</i></b> | Throughout the first two chapters, Long develops a fifteen-point critique of the ecclesial ethicists by the Augustinians, asking in the third and final chapter whether this is an unbridgeable divide. On some of the points, such as their common commitment to human finitude or what to make of immanent politics, there is plenty of room for convergence and alliance.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Augustinian and Ecclesial Christian Ethics - D.

  <title>First Dooowwwnnn…And Life to Go! - Red Cashion, Bill Parcells, Rusty Burson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When directed toward you, two of the more humbling words that can ever be uttered are: Youre fired! For Red Cashion, however, being fired by both the Southwest and Southland Conferences forced him to make significant attitude changes that took him all the way to the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Reds rise to prominence in the NFLmany sportswriters described him as the most well-known official NFL historywas primarily the result of Cashion adopting a much more enthusiastic approach. He only achieved his dreams when he stopped blending into the background and began passionately asserting his personality with a trademark call that became recognized across the country. First dooowwwnnnand life to go! is an inspiring, captivating story that accentuates the power of a positive attitude. Cashion also recounts fascinating stories about some of the NFLs biggest personalities during his 25-year tenure in the league, and he provides strong opinions about the games current direction. Cashions advice for protecting current players from concussions, for example, is as revolutionary as it is rudimentary. His vision of the NFLs future is every bit as intriguing as his colorful description of his time in the league. 
Red represented quality, judgment and a little special flair!  Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue

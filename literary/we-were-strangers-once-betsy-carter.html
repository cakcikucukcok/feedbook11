      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;/i&gt;The Nightingale &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Brooklyn &lt;i&gt;comes&lt;/i&gt; an exquisite and unforgettable novel about friendship, love, and redemption in a circle of immigrants who flee Europe for 1930s-era New York City.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Carter&#39;s warm and beautiful prose brings us love, tragedy, mystery and hope in a moving celebration of America and the people who have come to it.&quot; -- Amy Bloom, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lucky Us&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Away&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  On the eve of World War II Egon Schneider--a gallant and successful Jewish doctor, son of two world-famous naturalists--escapes Germany to an uncertain future across the sea. Settling into the unfamiliar rhythms of upper Manhattan, he finds solace among a tight-knit group of fellow immigrants, tenacious men and women drawn together as much by their differences as by their memories of the world they left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  They each suffer degradations and triumphs large and small: Egon&#39;s terminally acerbic lifelong friend, bestselling author Meyer Leavitt, now wears a sandwich board on a New York street corner; Catrina Harty, the headstrong daughter of a dirt-poor Irish trolley driver, survives heartbreak and loss to forge an unlikely alliance; and Egon himself is forced to abandon his thriving medical practice to become the &quot;Cheese Man&quot; at a Washington Heights grocery. But their spirits remain unbroken, and when their little community is faced with an existential threat, these strangers rise up together in hopes of creating a permanent home. With her uncanny ability to create indelible characters in unforgettable circumstances, bestselling author Betsy Carter has crafted a gorgeous novel that will resonate with anyone who has ever felt adrift and longed for home." />

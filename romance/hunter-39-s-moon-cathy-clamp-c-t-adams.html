  <title>Hunter&#39;s Moon - Cathy Clamp, C.T. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;HER ONLY OPTION IS DEATH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Quentin has reached the end of her rope-she&#39;s desperate, and there&#39;s only one way out. Her plan doesn&#39;t include falling for Tony, the mysterious hit man she hires. He listens when she speaks and somehow convinces her that maybe her problems aren&#39;t entirely insurmountable. He even thinks her little potbelly is sexy. So he&#39;s a werewolf--everyone has flaws! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue enjoys being coddled by Tony, and, for his part, Tony likes the way Sue moans when he touches her. She begins to think she and Tony might have a shot at a future together, despite his unorthodox profession . . . and even though she doesn&#39;t know his real name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Tony&#39;s enemies-not all of whom are fully human-decide Sue makes a perfect target, will Tony risk letting his darker side out during the day to save her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

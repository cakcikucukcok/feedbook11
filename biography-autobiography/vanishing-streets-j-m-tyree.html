  <title>Vanishing Streets - J. M. Tyree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Vanishing Streets&lt;/i&gt; reveals an American writer&#39;s twenty-year love affair with London. Beguiling and idiosyncratic, obsessive and wry, it offers an illustrated travelogue of the peripheries, retracing some of London&#39;s most curious locations. As J. M. Tyree wanders deliriously in &quot;the world&#39;s most visited city,&quot; he rediscovers and reinvents places that have changed drastically since he was a student at Cambridge in the 1990s. Tyree stumbles into the ghosts of Alfred Hitchcock, Graham Greene, and the pioneers of the British Free Cinema Movement. He offers a new way of seeing familiar landmarks through the lens of film history, and reveals strange nooks and tiny oddities in out-of-the-way places, from a lost film by John Ford supposedly shot in Wapping to the beehives hidden in Tower Hamlets Cemetery, an area haunted by a translation error in W. G. Sebald&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Austerlitz&lt;/i&gt;.
This book blends deeply personal writing with a foreigner&#39;s observations on a world capital experiencing an unsettling moment of transition. &lt;i&gt;Vanishing Streets&lt;/i&gt; builds into an astonishing and innovative multi-layered project combining autobiography, movie madness, and postcard-like annotations on the magical properties of a great city. Tyree argues passionately for London as a cinematic dream city of perpetual fascinations and eccentricities, bridging the past and the present as well as the real and the imaginary." />

&lt;BR&gt; How does God call people into service for himself?&lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; To what extent is God faithful to his promises to his followers? &lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; What is expected of a servant of God? &lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; How can Christian parents and grandparents have positive influences on their family members? &lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; What are the advantages and disadvantages of being involved in an internationally networked branch of the Christian church? &lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; What advice for life could come from a couple of committed Christians approaching 50 years of marriage? &lt;/BR&gt;

  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Brené Brown&#39;s The Gifts of Imperfection - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Brené Brown&#39;s The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You&#39;re Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Brené Brown, noted psychologist and author, has collected thousands of stories about shame from diverse men and women in the United States. Using the data collected from these stories, Brown provides suggestions for readers who want to move past feelings of shame and unworthiness and towards “Wholehearted Living.” 
Brown states that Wholehearted Living is not a one-time decision, but a process that takes a lifetime. Brown’s goal is to bring awareness and clarity to the choices that can lead to Wholehearted Living by examining the success stories of the people that she has interviewed. Brown states that the empirical evidence suggests that men and women who engage in Wholehearted Living have learned how to DIG Deep. DIG Deep is an acronym that stands for: Deliberate in their thoughts and behaviors through prayer, meditation, or simply setting their intentions; Inspired to make new and different choices; Going." />

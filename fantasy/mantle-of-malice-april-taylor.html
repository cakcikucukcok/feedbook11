  <title>Mantle of Malice - April Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;England&#39;s infant heir has been kidnapped, and there&#39;s only one man who can find him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Luke Ballard has dedicated his talents&amp;#8212;and his life&amp;#8212;to protecting the throne. As Henry IX&#39;s Privy Inquirer and Dominus Elemancer, his loyalty is no longer in question. But when Queen Madeline&#39;s coronation is interrupted with the news that Arthur, the baby Prince of Wales, has been abducted, Luke is given an ultimatum: retrieve the royal heir and prevent future threats to the royal family or lose his head.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;That the young prince has been taken by dark forces is clear. The evil sorcerers of Custodes Tenebris will not rest until they hold power in England with Catholic Mary as a puppet Queen. Luke has bested them before, but he&#39;s never needed to defeat evil while falling in love&amp;#8212;Arthur&#39;s nursemaid, the beautiful Blanche Oliver, has won him over with her seductive charms.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As Luke&#39;s investigation leads into the dark recesses of his own family&#39;s past, Blanche&#39;s hold on him deepens. With the fate of the Tudors hanging in the balance, Luke will need to draw upon untested strength and sort truth from feminine fiction&amp;#8230;for the enemy&#39;s reach is long and time is running out.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book three of The Tudor Enigma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;99,000 words" />

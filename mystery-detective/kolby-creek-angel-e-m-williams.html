  <title>Kolby Creek Angel - E.M. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kari Clark is raised by her grandmother in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. With little hope of a career in the tiny village of Kolby Creek, she learns from a faith oriented upbringing to be content. Kari learns to be thankful, to work hard and that she will eventually be rewarded; believing we reap what we sow. She is taught to be kind to strangers, believing some have entertained angels unaware. 
The girls Scottish-Cherokee heritage gives her an inner strength to persevere, against all odds. 
Kari dreams of becoming a fashion designer, but knows it is an unlikely dream. Then suddenly her life reaches an unexpected turning point. 
Kari answers the knock on her door to find herself looking into the mysterious blue eyes of an elderly hobo. She gets a strange feeling that he is there on a mission, never dreaming her life will be changed forever. Karis kindness to the stranger catapults her unwittingly, into the midst of the city that never sleeps, and into a web of intrigue, danger and suspense. Ultimately, Kari finds that angels do exist; and that her angel was there all the time, waiting in the wings." />

  <title>It&#39;s Like That - Rev. Joseph Simmons Run</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Money, success, and widespread adulation: Run of Run-DMC, one of the first rappers to achieve nationwide recognition and top-selling albums, seemed to have it all in his heyday. But the dizzying effects of fame soon left Run feeling empty and dissatisfied. Stuck in a pit of despair, he went through the motions of his public life while grappling with his loss of direction and a family life that was falling apart. Here is the story of how he turned his life around, discovering a wellspring of spirituality within himself and a special connection with God. Now an ordained minister, Run talks in this extraordinary book about his profound life change and getting the message out to the community.  Still a major rap performer, with an album entitled Crown Royal and frequent appearances on MTV, Run is truly a rennaissance man. A spiritual memoir unlike any other, &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s Like That&lt;/i&gt; captures the innocence of youth, the pain of chaos, and the joy that one can only find through righteous living.  This is an epic and absorbing tale from one of the most popular and complex performers of our times." />

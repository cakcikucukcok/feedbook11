  <title>Pepperfish Keys - Darryl Wimberley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is a &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; that has nothing to do with Disney World. Nothing to do with palm trees or Holiday Inns. Tourists are neither courted nor coddled in this &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Florida&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and you can go a hundred miles and never find a golden arch. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So says author Darryl Wimberley, and it&#39;s a Florida he knows. He knows, too, that in towns like Pepperfish Keys, there are those who still can&#39;t believe that a black man could rise to a high position in the state police. But Barrett Raines has done it; his father may have been a moneyless fisherman enriching his white employer, but things have changed---a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Fowler, a local television reporter, isn&#39;t concerned with Barrett&#39;s race---she wouldn&#39;t have cared if he were pink and green. She just wants to use him to get him (and, she hopes, the state&#39;s senator as well) into some kind of blazing trouble that will let her write a prize-wining story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Baxter Stanton, of course, knows how important it is that the town&#39;s voters consider him &quot;their man&quot; in the upcoming election. There are activities he would like to stay hidden, and his young daughter, whom he can&#39;t harness, is having a fling with a man whom Barrett suspects is dealing with the senator in some kind of illegal business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things happen that neither Barrett nor Sharon expected, throwing them into an unlikely alliance. The dead body of the senator&#39;s daughter is discovered behind a water heater in the senator&#39;s mansion. Can Raines pull the threads together---and find out what they mean? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set along the northwestern coast of Florida&#39;s Big Bend, &lt;i&gt;Pepperfish Keys&lt;/i&gt; is an amazing addition to this riveting Florida Gulf noir series.&lt;/p&gt;" />

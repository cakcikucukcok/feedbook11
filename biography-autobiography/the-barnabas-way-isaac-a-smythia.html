  <title>The Barnabas Way - Isaac A Smythia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The apostle Barnabas may be one of the most overlooked and yet most influential leaders of the New Testament. His impact on the church began with a simple gift to feed hungry believers, then grew into much more. Barnabas was trusted by the original apostles to lead the first organized church outside of Jerusalem, Antioch. He mentored Paul and later Mark, and pioneered the first missionary outreach of the early church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Barnabas Way follows the journey of this amazing leader across the pages of Acts, gleaning the important leadership principles that Barnabas leaves along the way. Those principles set a pattern that Paul and many others have followed, a chain of leadership (or influence) that stretches from the first century to today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnabas saw what others did not see. He did what others would not do. And Barnabas paid a price that others did not pay to build the kingdom of God in the lives of those he influenced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

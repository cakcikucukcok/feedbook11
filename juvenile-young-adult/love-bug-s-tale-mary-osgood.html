  <title>Love Bug’S Tale - Mary Osgood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary Osgood has done it again! Love Bug is an incredibly sweet
story that perfectly describes the trauma that many children face
as they navigate life in the foster care and adoption systems. In
fact, as I read the story to my 11-year-old, he said, Hey, she
used my life to tell that story! That is what I do. He recognized
himself in Love Bugs behaviors. What I really loved about this
story is that it carefully shows that there is a reason behind the
behaviors. If we dont understand what it is that is behind them,
we will never be able to successfully address those behaviors.
My children and I enjoyed the story, and I imagine that
all other children and parents will, too. As we read about
Love Bug and his forever mom, we smiled big huge smiles,
looked deep into each others eyes, and then shared warm
and snugly hugs. The story is special, and reading it with
my children allowed us to experience some profoundly intimate
moments. It allowed us a chance to talk about some very diffi cult issues
in an easy and non-threatening manner. Seeing cute little puppies facing the challenges
of foster care made it easier for my children to discuss those challenges in their own lives.
Thank you, Mary, for this treasure. You are a gem and your stories are priceless.

Finally, a book for kids experiencing the insecurity associated with foster care and visitation!
Love Bugs Tale takes away the rejection and allows the child to view their situation through
a new lens.

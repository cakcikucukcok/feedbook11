  <title>The Chaos Crystal - Jennifer Fallon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The magical Tide has turned and the Immortal Lords once again have their full power. The Immortal Lord Cayal welcomes this power as a means to an end--his end, preferably.  Cayal has wanted to cease his existence for longer than human history and it looks like he might finally get his wish.  Rumors swirl that the Chaos Crystal, the mysterious prism that brought the Immortals to the world, has been found. Cayal is determined to seize the gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who search for this long-lost object is Cayal&#39;s former lover, the very mortal Lady Arkady.  She&#39;s been captured by Jaxyn, a Tide Lord who is decidedly against Cayal and is seeking the Crystal for his own nefarious schemes. Arkady escapes, and is off on her desperate search...for if the gem falls into the hands of the Immortals, what will become of humanity?&lt;br&gt;The stakes are high, with mortal and immortal fighting to grasp this ultimate prize. Whoever holds the Crystal can decide the fate of the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

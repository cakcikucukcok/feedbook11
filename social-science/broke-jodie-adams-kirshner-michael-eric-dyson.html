  <title>Broke - Jodie Adams Kirshner, Michael Eric Dyson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Essential...in showcasing people who are persistent, clever, flawed, loving, struggling and full of contradictions, &lt;i&gt;Broke&lt;/i&gt; affirms why it&#39;s worth solving the hardest problems in our most challenging cities in the first place. &quot;   --&lt;b&gt;Anna Clark,&lt;i&gt; The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Through in-depth reporting of structural inequality as it affects real people in Detroit, Jodie Adams Kirshner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Broke&lt;/i&gt; examines one side of the economic divide in America&quot; --&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What &lt;i&gt;Broke&lt;/i&gt; really tells us is how systems of government, law and finance can crush even the hardiest of boot-strap pullers.&quot; --&lt;b&gt;Brian Alexander, author of&lt;i&gt; Glass House&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A galvanizing, narrative account of a city&#39;s bankruptcy and its aftermath told through &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;the lives of seven valiantly struggling Detroiters&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bankruptcy and the austerity it represents have become a common &quot;solution&quot; for struggling American cities. What do the spending cuts and limited resources do to the lives of city residents? In &lt;i&gt;Broke,&lt;/i&gt; Jodie Adams Kirshner follows seven Detroiters as they navigate life during and after their city&#39;s bankruptcy. Reggie loses his savings trying to make a habitable home for his family. Cindy fights drug use, prostitution, and dumping on her block. Lola commutes two hours a day to her suburban job. For them, financial issues are mired within the larger ramifications of poor urban policies, restorative negligence on the state and federal level and--even before the decision to declare Detroit bankrupt in 2013--the root causes of a city&#39;s fiscal demise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Like Matthew Desmond&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Evicted&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Broke&lt;/i&gt; looks at what municipal distress means, not just on paper but in practical--and personal--terms. More than 40 percent of Detroit&#39;s 700,000 residents fall below the poverty line. Post-bankruptcy, they struggle with a broken real estate market, school system, and job market--and their lives have not improved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Detroit is emblematic. Kirshner makes a powerful argument that cities--the economic engine of America--are never quite given the aid that they need by either the state or federal government for their residents to survive, not to mention flourish. Success for all America&#39;s citizens depends on equity of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;" />

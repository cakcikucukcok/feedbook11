  <title>Wild Bill Hickok - Ira Zweifach, William B. ,Jr. Jones, William B. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;James Butler Hickok (May 27, 1837 - August 2, 1876), better known as Wild Bill Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West. His skills as a gunfighter and scout, along with his reputation as a lawman, provided the basis for his fame, although some of his exploits are fictionalized. Hickok came to the West as a stagecoach driver, then he became a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska. He fought for the Union Army during the American Civil War, and gained publicity after the war as a scout, marksman, actor, and professional gambler. Between his law-enforcement duties and gambling, which easily overlapped, Hickok was involved in several notable shootouts. He was shot and killed while playing poker in the Number Ten Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory (now South Dakota).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimized for Kindle devices and featuring Panel Zoom facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its beginnings in the 1940&#39;s to today, Classics Illustrated continues to encourage a love of reading and adventure in youthful minds through beautifully-illustrated comic book adaptations of the world&#39;s most beloved stories by the world&#39;s greatest authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collection of Classics Illustrated books is an inviting start to any young person&#39;s library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;" />

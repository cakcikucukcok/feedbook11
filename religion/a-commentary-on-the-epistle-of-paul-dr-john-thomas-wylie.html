  <title>A Commentary on the Epistle of Paul - Dr. John Thomas Wylie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book, A Commentary on the Epistle of Paul: The Apostle to The Hebrews is to provide an inspiring, systematic, devotional, biblical study for laypersons and clergy alike. Like Paul, Dr. Wylie intends to show the superiority and finality of Gods Revelation to men through Jesus Christ as over against Judaism or any other previous revelation of God. 
Another purpose for this book is to inform discouraged Christians and to render spiritual support from the epistle to the Hebrews and by innumerable examples both of Christ and those who had successfully live by faith. Central to the purpose of this writing is the necessity to look away from our trials, tribulations, and life circumstances and look unto Jesus Christ, the author and finisher of our faith, who reigns as the Supreme Example above all and over all in heaven and earth forever. Like Paul, Dr. Wylies reasoning in behalf of the readers is that this is what the New Testament church needs above all else to make us all strong (and keep us strong) in the Christian faith. 
Central to the heart of this commentary as that of Hebrews is the concept of Christ as the perfect example and perfect high priest of God, who establishes the new covenant both by his priestly work and his sacrificial death." />

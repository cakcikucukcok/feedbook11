  <title>Cussy Rode a &#39;34 - Marty Beebe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cussy rode a big faded red 1934 motorcycle in and around the small town of Oasis.  Where at the west end of Topple Street, a locally owned grocery store made headline news, on memorial-day weekend, June 1948.  Although a premeditated crime occurred inside the market that warm summer evening, the entire dramatic ordeal merely began what was to become a precursor of unprecedented summer events.  
Where unpredictable madness coat tails chaos, and a small group of colorful, neighborly individuals, erupt in zany notoriety one after thee other.  From outlaw to lawmen the cast of characters amasses throughout the summer months, crossing paths and briefly uniting for a good cause.  
But, according to 6-year-old Eko Jett, a lot of lives on Topple Street are not as clear as they may appear.  Even still itll be a summer to remember.  Especially after what some people deemed so terribly bad, turned out to be so awfully good.  And yes Eko Jett wont forget, Cussy rode a 34." />

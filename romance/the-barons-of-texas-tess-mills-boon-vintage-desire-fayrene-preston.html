  <title>The Barons Of Texas: Tess (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Desire) - Fayrene Preston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tess Baron knew she was in trouble the second she laid eyes on the mysterious - and oh-so-sexy - stranger. Why had Nick Trejo suddenly appeared, asking her for a private meeting? And what was it about Nick that made Tess long to be in his arms… ?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nick was on a quest to discover his family&#39;s fortune, and he wasn&#39;t going to let some beautiful heiress stand in his way - even if he was falling in love with her. Or could the treasure he&#39;d been searching for his entire life be less precious than the treasure he&#39;d just found - Tess&#39;s love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The Barons of Texas: Meet the Baron sisters - Tess, Jill and Kit. Inheriting the family fortune is easy. But what about falling in love?&lt;/em&gt;

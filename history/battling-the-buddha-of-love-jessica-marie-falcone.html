  <title>Battling the Buddha of Love - Jessica Marie Falcone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Battling the Buddha of Love&lt;/I&gt; is a work of advocacy anthropology that explores the controversial plans and practices of the Maitreya Project, a transnational Buddhist organization, as it sought to build the &quot;world&#39;s tallest statue&quot; as a multi-million-dollar &quot;gift&quot; to India. Hoping to forcibly acquire 750 acres of occupied land for the statue park in the Kushinagar area of Uttar Pradesh, the Buddhist statue planners ran into obstacle after obstacle, including a full-scale grassroots resistance movement of Indian farmers working to &quot;Save the Land.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Falcone sheds light on the aspirations, values, and practices of both the Buddhists who worked to construct the statue, as well as the Indian farmer-activists who tirelessly protested against the Maitreya Project. Because the majority of the supporters of the Maitreya Project statue are converts to Tibetan Buddhism, individuals Falcone terms &quot;non-heritage&quot; practitioners, she focuses on the spectacular collision of cultural values between small agriculturalists in rural India and transnational Buddhists hailing from Portland to Pretoria. She asks how could a transnational Buddhist organization committed to compassionate practice blithely create so much suffering for impoverished rural Indians&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Falcone depicts the cultural logics at work on both sides of the controversy, and through her examination of these logics she reveals the divergent, competing visions of Kushinagar’s potential futures. &lt;I&gt;Battling the Buddha of Love&lt;/I&gt; traces power, faith, and hope through the axes of globalization, transnational religion, and rural grassroots activism in South Asia, showing the unintended local consequences of an international spiritual development project.&lt;/P&gt;" />

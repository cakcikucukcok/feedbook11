  <title>The Mcknight I Knew - Seymour Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Presently, when people speak about McKnight, it is in the context of crime. The author Seymour Tally Davis was born and spent the first 30 years of his life growing up in McKnight. During these years McKnight never had this reputation of a Gangster Town. The McKnight I Knew was written in an attempt to give the public another picture of the authors birthplace. If you believe that this book will be another boring presentation of historical facts, please change your mind! Facts will be presented, but in a funny, fresh, storytelling form. Dont be surprised if you find yourself smiling as you read.
   Secondly, this book is not only for McKnighters. This book is an excellent read with much universal application. Wherever you are from you will be able to read this book and reflect on the area in which you grew up and realize that you had so much in common with McKnight. This is especially true when it came to how you were raised back in the day. Purchase this book and be informed and entertained at the same time." />

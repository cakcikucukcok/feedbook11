Most are slaves to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed by the gods with lives of comfort and splendor, the royal elite routinely perform their duties, yet some chafe at their role. A young woman of stunning ambition, Princess Phela refuses to allow a few obstacles&amp;#8212;including her mother the queen and her brother, the heir apparent&amp;#8212;stand in the way of claiming ultimate power and glory for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far below the royals are the Bajuman. Poor and oppressed, members of this wretched caste have but two paths out of servitude: the priesthood . . . or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because magic has been kept at bay in Quandis, royals and Bajuman have lived together in an uneasy peace for centuries. But Princess Phela&amp;#8217;s desire for power will disrupt the realm&amp;#8217;s order, setting into motion a series of events that will end with her becoming a goddess in her own right . . . or ultimately destroying Quandis and all its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;" />

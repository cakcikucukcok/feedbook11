  <title>For the Love of the Ocean - Christine Lynn Lourenco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Summer Wright grows up an only child in Avon-by-the-Sea, New Jersey, an affluent town situated next to the Atlantic Ocean. But when she is sixteen, Summers idyllic childhood is transformed into a nightmare when her parents die in a car accident. Stricken with grief, she turns to her friends for comfort and help through the remainder of high school and college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chase has been Summers friend since she was born. Their families have always vacationed together and the teens share a love for night surfing. Although both sense there is something deeper under the surface, neither wants to pursue it for fear of losing their friendship. During college, both Chase and Summer date others. But just as college is ending and Summer is facing a big decision about whether to stay in Avon-by-the-Sea or move for a job, Chase finally gets the nerve to tell Summer how he really feels. As Summer struggles to understand her feelings for Chase, she must learn to trust her heart, for it never lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For the Love of the Ocean&lt;/i&gt; is a nostalgic tale of romance, self-discovery, loss, and new beginnings as two childhood friends face a monumental turning point in their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Digital Library Programs for Libraries and Archives - Aaron D. Purcell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planning and managing a self-contained digitization project is one thing, but how do you transition to a digital library program? Or better yet, how do you start a program from scratch? In this book Purcell, a well-respected expert in both archives and digital libraries, combines theory and best practices with practical application, showing how to approach digital projects as an ongoing effort. He not only guides librarians and archivists in transitioning from project-level initiatives to a sustainable program but also provides clear step-by-step instructions for building a digital library program from the bottom up, even for organizations with limited staff. Approachable and easy to follow, this book
    traces the historical growth of digital libraries and the importance of those digital foundations;
    summarizes current technological challenges that affect the planning of digital libraries, and how librarians and archivists are adapting to the changing information landscape;
    uses examples to lay out the core priorities of leading successful digital programs;
    covers the essentials of getting started, from vision and mission building to identifying resources and partnerships;
    emphasizes the importance of digitizing original unique materials found in library and archives collections, and suggests approaches to the selection process;
    addresses metadata and key technical standards;
    discusses management and daily operations, including assessment, enhancement, sustainability, and long-term preservation planning;
    provides guidance for marketing, promotion, and outreach, plus how to take into account such considerations as access points, intended audiences, and educational and instructional components;  and
    includes exercises designed to help readers define their own digital projects and create a real-world digital program plan.
Equally valuable for LIS students just learning about the digital landscape, information professionals taking their first steps to create digital content, and organizations who already have well-established digital credentials, Purcell’s book outlines methods applicable and scalable to many different types and sizes of libraries and archives." />

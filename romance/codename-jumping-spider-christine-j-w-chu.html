  <title>Codename: Jumping Spider - Christine J. W. Chu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the small town of Tirjuan, a series of murders has been taking place. Girls have gone missing mysteriously, only to be found dead with no apparent cause of death. Three years later, the local authorities are no closer to finding out who the serial killer is. The investigation into these unsolved murders continues as more names are added to the list of victims.
Now the unsolved murder cases of Tirjuan have been brought to the attention of the National Security Secret Service. The NSSS, now taking over the investigation, decides to bring in one of their finest agents to handle these unsolved mysteries. Ironically, this was the home town of Special Agent Catherine Nelson, code name Jumping Spider, filled with her past associates and memories. She possesses a sharp and almost unparalleled acuity, but will it be enough for her to take down a serial killer who might be hiding among her trusted ones?" />

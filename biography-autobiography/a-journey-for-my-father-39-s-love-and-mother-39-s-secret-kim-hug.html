  <title>A Journey for My Father&#39;s Love and Mother&#39;s Secret - Kim Hug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When hope dies in a person, life seems over for them. This candid autobiography chronicles the story of a woman who lost hope. Her only solution was to attempt suicide, but on the night she tried to end her life, she found a miracle that would change her life forever. This book traces her journey though abandonment, sexual abuse, secrets, and paranoid psychosis, a journey that did not ultimately lead her to death but to life. She was many times lost in delusions of unreality and spent countless days in mental institutions, seeking answers to a way out of the darkness of her life. But the answer came when Jesus found her, her haunting memories were revealed, and she began to walk down a new, healing road. Here Kim Hug speaks of the power of Jesus and how he gave healing and hope to her life through many faithful people. This story was written through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is filled with creative pictures of memories and poetry as Kim rewalked her life over again to find the missing pieces to the puzzle of her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

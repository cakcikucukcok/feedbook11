  <title>Otherness and Power: Michael Jackson and His Media Critics - Susan Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Otherness and Power: Michael Jackson and His Media Critics is an innovative study of the cultural impact of Michael Jackson. Jackson had millions of ardent fans around the world, but from the early days of his adult career many in the media mocked and reviled him. How did such divergent attitudes come about? This book examines the origins and psychological underpinnings of the media&#39;s hostility by closely analyzing some of the most harshly critical writings about Jackson. While racism and discomfort with Jackson&#39;s &quot;otherness&quot; have previously been recognized as the elements that fueled media criticisms, Susan Woodward reveals another important factor: the perception that Jackson was extraordinarily powerful, in ways that went beyond celebrity and wealth. Through research and careful analysis, Woodward explores the ways in which Jackson&#39;s power was seen, the largely unconscious response to his power, the functions of the media&#39;s criticisms and the origins of the perceptions of Jackson&#39;s power." />

  <title>A Cauldron of Spirits - Charles W Massie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;StarShow Publications has announced the release of&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; A Cauldron of Spirits,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a collection of short stories written by International Author Charles W. Massie. These stories have been written over the last three decades, and have been updated to make them more contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication should be a welcome addition for any reader. The topics include a bit of science fiction, a bit of fantasy, a bit or horror and even a bit of spirituality. There are 10 tales of varying lengths, which makes the book ideal for those readers who want a quick infusion of fiction; as opposed to opening up a full-length novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is being made available in Hardcover, Paperback and Ebook formats. Availability channels include &lt;u&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Barnes and Noble.com&lt;/u&gt;, as well as many other retailers. If your store doesn&amp;#39;t carry it in stock, they can easily order it from Ingram or Baker and Taylor distributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the format, the page count runs between 128 and 255 pages. It has been typeset in easy-to-read Bookman Old Style font. This collection is the perfect book to take with you when you are waiting for your car to be repaired or sitting in a doctor&amp;#39;s office. Additional information, including other books in our catalog, can be found at the website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starshowpublications.com/&quot;&gt;www.starshowpublications.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />

Carlos, I had the opportunity to read your poems and found them to be quite intriguing,
placing one in a state of absence interminable. Th e collection of verse and prose tends to touch
the hearts and souls of the readers as they refl ect upon the subject in question, often ending
with the perception that it is I, the reader, whom the author is writing about.
Marie Conceptia Girault, Essex County College

around him are represented in his work. Your words paint a vivid picture of the moments.
Well done, my friend, well done.

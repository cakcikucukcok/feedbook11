  <title>Exploring the Libraries of the  U.S. Presidents - Leonard V. Kalkwarf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What a thrill it was to visit our first presidential library. It was the beginning of an incredible journey that resulted in visiting all of the presidential libraries, which we seek to share with you in this book. As of this date, there are thirteen presidential libraries, which belong to the National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to take you along on this journey, giving you our impressions and underscoring some of the historic events these visits called to remembrance. The libraries are a glimpse into the lives of the men whose decisions and actions have made our nation what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fascinating and revealing journey this has been. To visit one or all of the presidential libraries is an extraordinary experience and has heightened not only our understanding of the presidents but also of American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did something else. It gave us a destination, making it possible for us to visit some very interesting places across the country. Both of us are now retired after each of us spent fifty years in our chosen professions. Not only do we have the time to travel but the continuation of our life-long pursuit to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after we began our visits, we broadened our goal to visit at least one or more historic sites associated with each of our former presidents, frequently that would be their birthplace or some major event associated with their life. Eight years later we have achieved our goalwe have visited all thirteen libraries and one or more sites related to each of our forty-three former presidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy visiting the presidential libraries through the reading of this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />

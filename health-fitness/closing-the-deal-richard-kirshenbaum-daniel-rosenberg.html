  <title>Closing the Deal - Richard Kirshenbaum, Daniel Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this hip and utterly indispensable guide, two happily married husbands and regular guys reveal the secrets to getting a man down on bended knee -- his most uncomfortable position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Richard Kirshenbaum and Daniel Rosenberg have dispensed loads of successful relationship advice to friends, colleagues, and relatives, who then pushed the ex-bachelors to share their lessons with the masses of future brides who need help taking their existing relationships to the next level. These guys have been there and know what it takes to get even the biggest commitment phobes to take the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closing the Deal&lt;/em&gt; will help you make a realistic assessment of your relationship and offers a fresh perspective on how your man&#39;s mind works. You&#39;ll find a new way to drive your relationship toward marriage without resorting to game playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors promote the importance of truth telling, self-positioning, and the artful use of marketing tactics to reel in your man. You don&#39;t have to be the prettiest, thinnest, or richest woman to close the deal -- there is an art to it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closing the Deal&lt;/em&gt; is not about outsmarting your man to the altar -- it&#39;s about learning to understand him. Richard and Daniel explain that no matter how much a guy may love his significant other, Change is the Enemy, so wannabe brides everywhere must convince their boyfriends that marriage is man&#39;s best friend. &lt;strong&gt;Closing the Deal&lt;/strong&gt; will show you how to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help future brides build their matrimonial muscles and monitor their progress, Richard and Daniel include quizzes and real-life scenarios and throw in a glossary for extra clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honest and supportive, funny and straightforward, these ideal big brothers offer a sure cure for the wedding-bell blues.&lt;/p&gt;" />

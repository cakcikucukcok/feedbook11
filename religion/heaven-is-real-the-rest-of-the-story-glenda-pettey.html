      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean that my name is not in the book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I have done everything necessary to be allowed into Heaven. Look again!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; Ron Pettey commanded the gentleman behind the check-in table in the foyer of Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During his emergency brain surgery, Ron Pettey was allowed an incredible tour in the heavenly realm. To his chagrin, he learned that his time on earth was not up&amp;mdash;his mission was not complete. The angel who accompanied Ron back to earth explained, &amp;ldquo;Your mission is to win others to Christ and strengthen other Christians . . . and you can do that by sharing this testimony.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Walk with them through their trials and triumphs and allow the Holy Spirit to bring you into a deeper relationship with your Heavenly Father. Now that Ron has made Heaven his final home, Glenda reveals the rest of the story. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; You will be convinced that God loves you and that Heaven Is REAL!&lt;/p&gt;" />

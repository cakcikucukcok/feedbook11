  <title>Who Is Phaedrus?: Keys to Plato&#39;s Dyad Masterpiece - Marshell Carl Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who Is Phaedrus?   This book delivers answers.  Many have said Phaedrus is the most intriguing of Plato&#39;s works. Phaedrus is certainly one of the most difficult to follow and fathom. In part this is because the title figure, Phaedrus himself, has remained a mystery.  Who Is Phaedrus? takes us on a tour of this intricate dialogue: a work of philosophy and history, and a work of art.   In Who Is Phaedrus? we see how and why Phaedrus became involved in the most sensational scandals, both religious and political, in ancient Athens; and yet we see Phaedrus come across as a person remarkably contemporary, someone who could walk through a time seam and be wholly understandable as a soul in the twenty-first century.  Perplexed as well as perplexing, Phaedrus, in the final analysis, needs Socrates&#39; timeless philosophy as a salve and therapy, and we follow along as Socrates delivers." />

  <title>Jackson - Dr. Paul Vickery, Stephen Mansfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Orphan. Frontiersman. President. The rise of Andrew Jackson to the highest office in America has become a legend of leadership, perseverance, and ambition. Central to Jackson&#39;s historic climb&lt;B&gt;?&lt;/B&gt;long before the White House—was his military service. Scarred permanently as a child by the sword of a British soldier, Jackson grew into an unwavering leader, a general whose charisma and sheer force of personality called to mind those of George Washington a generation earlier.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As commander of the Tennessee militia in the War of 1812, Jackson became &quot;Old Hickory,&quot; the indomitable spearhead in a series of bloody conflicts with Creek Indians on the southwest frontier. Slight of frame with silver hair that seemed to stand on command, Jackson once stood down a mutinous brigade as an army of one. Then came New Orleans. Author Paul Vickery chronicles Jackson&#39;s defining battle and the decisions a single, impassioned commander made to ensure a growing nation could, once and for all, be free of British might. The hero of New Orleans infused America, for the first time, with a sense of nationalism.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Jackson was decisive and unforgiving, a commander firmly in his element. In his own words, &quot;One man with courage makes a majority.&quot; The lessons of one extraordinary general endure.&lt;/P&gt;" />

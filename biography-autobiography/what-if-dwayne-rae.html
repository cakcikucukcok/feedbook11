  <title>What If - Dwayne Rae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; How many of us have made the decision to put ourselves at-risk in the work site? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now that we have answered that question with, I have, how many of us have ever sat around after making that decision and said, I knew that was going to happen? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This book is about watching people very early on in my career who constantly took risks to benefit the companys bottom line. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When I saw others do it, I decided to do it also. The results were a life time of escalating at-risk behaviour and then ultimately paying a tremendous personal price for it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In this book I share my revelations, and rationalise why I and others like me kept doing the unsafe acts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I share many heartfelt stories, some that end humourously and some that end tragically. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I promise you that everything in this book is a real as it gets. Sometimes fact is indeed more terrifying than fiction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thousands of people have attended my seminars and been moved by my lifetime of recollections. This book continues the sharing process on larger scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For all the wrong reasons, please enjoy this book of my life. &lt;/p&gt;" />

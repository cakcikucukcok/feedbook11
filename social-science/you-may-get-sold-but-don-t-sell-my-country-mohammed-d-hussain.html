  <title>You May Get Sold but Don’T Sell My Country - Mohammed D. Hussain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains details of how tyranny has risen in Bangladesh, the country that was founded in 1971 with the principle of democracy. 
It hopes to answer why and how the hopes and aspirations of our people have been ruined due to corrupt politicians, intellectuals, and bureaucrats.
It hopes to answer why and how the evil totalitarian took place and how the current tyranny has been strengthened in such a horrific stage that the peace-loving people cant express their opinion under the ferocity of Sheikh Hasina.
In my writings, I have described the historical background of our country up to the modern tyrannical era, which shouldnt exist anywhere on the face of the planet in the twenty-first century.
In my writings, I have described how such an atrocious regime has been strengthened and why shouldnt they be forgiven. Freedom and liberty are the utmost universal values that no human being can sacrifice.
In this book, I have passionately written my views based on the real scenarios of Bangladesh and mixed with some essays and poems.
Knowing all about the risks, I believe that to live as human beings, we cant surrender to any dictator or oppressive regime. Surrendering to them will strengthen the evils, and we must restrain them by any means.  
No evil regime should represent any country or a nation or deny the very fundamental rights of their people. And Bangladesh is not an exception.
My main objective in writing this book is to protect the people of our country, Bangladesh, and its sovereignty. God bless Bangladesh and the entirety of mankind.

  <title>Bench - Nick Choo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A solitary wooden structure sits bathed in the shade of a tree. The small, inconspicuous neighborhood park bench seemingly has the power to summon a select few who need a brief respite from life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Leigh, a headstrong college student, just wants a peaceful break from the musty university library. As he sits on the bench to eat his lunch, he forges an unlikely friendship with a six-year-old boy that eventually forces him to rethink his entire philosophy on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derrick Weston has just faced rejection from the woman he wants to marry. As he seeks solace on the bench, he has no idea he is about to learn that his girlfriend has a secret that will dramatically impact both their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Cooke and his friends just want to feel free. As they meet at the bench illuminated by moonlight, they all soon learn that actions have consequences and that blood is not always thicker than water.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Septuagenarian Graham Hanson sits there with the love of his life, and learns the true meaning of marriage, companionship, and the phrase, Till death do us part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling tale, several ordinary people forced to confront complex issues are connected by one common denominatoran old, neglected bench in the middle of a grassy square.&lt;/p&gt;" />

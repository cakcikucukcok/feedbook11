  <title>The Man Who Tried to Get Away - Stephen R. Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Running away from yourself never works. You&#39;ll always catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Donaldson, at his trademark best, fleshes out the characters to the max...and it&#39;s all wrapped around a well-paced, cleverly-plotted mystery that will leave readers wanting more.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Charleston Post&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Killed His Brother&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mick &quot;Brew&quot; Axbrewder was once a great P.I.  That was before he accidentally shot and killed a cop--worse, a cop who happened to be his own brother.  Then Mick&#39;s partner, Ginny Fistoulari, blew off her own hand protecting him from a confrontation brought on by his alcoholism.  Unsurprisingly, Mick and Ginny aren&#39;t on great terms any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a week after an incident in which he was shot, barely back on his feet, Mick has agreed against his better judgement to join Ginny in providing security at a &quot;murder mystery camp&quot;, where a dozen people stay in an isolated, snowbound lodge to play at being detectives. Then a real killer starts bumping people off, one by one...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, Stephen Donaldson shows why he&#39;s regarded as one of America&#39;s greatest storytellers, with a tale of human pain and human triumph in &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Tried to Get Away&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

He moved to Pride when he was eight, after his mother&amp;rsquo;s mysterious disappearance.

But, after almost ten years of looking, with no luck, he makes his way back to his home town. But when tragedy strikes he&amp;rsquo;s given the opportunity of a lifetime. Being sheriff in the small town of Pride he has the chance to pursue the girl he just couldn&amp;#39;t keep his mind off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Amelia Blake can never forget the boy that saved her from certain danger ten years ago. When she comes home after her father&amp;rsquo;s death, she only plans on a short visit, but because of her mother&amp;rsquo;s health and after seeing Robert again, she is persuaded to move back home. When sparks fly she can&amp;rsquo;t help finding herself falling fast for the new sheriff in town.&lt;/p&gt;" />

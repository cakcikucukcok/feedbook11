        &lt;p&gt;Link Templeton had sworn he&#39; d never marry, yet he was now carrying a bride across the threshold. But Isabelle Fortune wasn&#39; t &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; bride, and it was his duty to protect the violet-eyed beauty from her intended groom.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Link was a man who valued duty above all things– including, apparently, his own sanity. Because sharing a remote cabin with this virginal seductress was testing his willpower. And he even seemed to be hallucinating, for he kept picturing wedding scenes with Isabelle as his radiant bride… and himself as her adoring groom!&lt;/p&gt;

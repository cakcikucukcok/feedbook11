  <title>A Bitter Feast - Deborah Crombie</title>

The Talbot family is wealthy, prominent, and powerful&amp;#8212;Melody&amp;#8217;s father is the publisher of one of London&amp;#8217;s largest and most influential newspapers. The centerpiece of this glorious fall getaway is a posh charity harvest luncheon catered by up-and-coming chef Viv Holland. After fifteen years in London&amp;#8217;s cut-throat food scene, Viv has returned to the Gloucestershire valleys of her childhood and quickly made a name for herself with her innovative meals based on traditional cuisine but using fresh local ingredients. Attended by the local well-to-do as well as national press&amp;#160;food bloggers and restaurant critics, the event could make Viv a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a tragic car accident and a series of mysterious deaths rock the estate and pull Duncan and Gemma into the investigation. It soon becomes clear that the killer has a connection with Viv&amp;#8217;s pub&amp;#8212;or, perhaps, with Beck House itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the truth lie in the past? Or is it closer to home, tied up in the tangled relationships and bitter resentments between the staff at Beck House and Viv&amp;#8217;s new pub? Or is it more personal, entwined with secrets hidden by Viv and those closest to her?&lt;/p&gt;" />

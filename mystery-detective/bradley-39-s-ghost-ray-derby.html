  <title>Bradley&#39;s Ghost - Ray Derby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Running Wolf sees the crashed aircraft, he photographs the corpses of the eighty-seven souls as they disappear, and the images bring to light the discovery of a diabolic deed. The National Transportation Safety Board quickly determines this is beyond their scope of responsibility and requests assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation moves from the Sioux Indian Reservation and state of South Dakota to Washington, D.C., when it becomes apparent that domestic terrorists with a biological agent are involved. Federal agencies headed by FBI Agent Bill Bradley race against time in their attempt to discover and apprehend the masterminds behind the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scheduled bio-terrorist exercise provides a perfect smoke screen for the aggressors to strike their first major blow to the citizens of the United States. In the government&#39;s attempt to contain the threat within the borders of South Dakota, the exercise changes to a genuine fight for survival. It becomes clear that the state and local levels of government have been under-funded and under-trained to counter the real threat of a biological attack. Support comes from a surprising entity as the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians sacrifice a sacred secret in order to offer safe haven to the citizens. But will it be enough?&lt;/p&gt;" />

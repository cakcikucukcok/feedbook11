  <title>China Goes Global: The Partial Power - David Shambaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most global citizens are well aware of the explosive growth of the Chinese economy. Indeed,  China has famously become the  workshop of the world. Yet, while China watchers have shed much light on the countrys internal dynamics--Chinas politics, its vast social changes, and its economic development--few have focused on how this increasingly powerful nation has become more active and assertive throughout the world.   In China Goes Global, eminent China scholar David Shambaugh delivers the book that many have been waiting for--a sweeping account of Chinas growing prominence on the international  stage. Thirty years ago, Chinas role in global affairs beyond its immediate East Asian periphery was decidedly minor and it had little geostrategic power. Today however, Chinas expanding economic power has allowed it to extend its reach virtually everywhere--from mineral mines in Africa, to currency markets in the West, to  oilfields in the Middle East, to agribusiness in Latin America, to the factories of East Asia. Shambaugh offers an enlightening look into the manifestations of Chinas global presence: its extensive commercial footprint, its growing military power,  its increasing cultural influence or soft power, its diplomatic activity, and its new prominence in global governance institutions.   But Shambaugh is no alarmist.  In this balanced and well-researched volume, he argues that Chinas global presence is more broad than deep and that China still lacks the influence befitting a major world power--what he terms a partial power. He draws on his decades of China-watching and his deep knowledge of the subject, and exploits a wide variety of previously untapped sources, to shed valuable light on Chinas current and future roles in world affairs." />

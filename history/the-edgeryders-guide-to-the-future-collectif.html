  <title>The Edgeryders guide to the future - Collectif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This publication is the result of the Edgeryders  project, an online dialogue platform run by the Council of Europe with a view to  promoting discussion with young people on the challenges of their transition to  working life.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Given that the imagination and  the experiences of young citizens can only be understood in the context of  horizontal relations (learning though sharing and joint management) in line with  the networking approach, which restores the significance of individual effort  and provides innovative solutions, a programme such as Edgeryders can provide a  future-oriented alternative. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In turn, institutions must show creativity.  It is no longer a case of managing inertia, but above all of creating a balance  between what the public authorities can do and what they can facilitate. By  adopting a spirit of co-operation, the authorities can encourage the sharing of  responsibilities, ideas, goods and values, while opening up to mutual learning.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Nevertheless, this type of interaction is only possible if two  conditions are met. Firstly, institutions must show a clear desire to ensure  unprecedented scope for dialogue with young people by ascribing a high value to  the proposals that emerge from the contacts among and with young citizens.  Secondly, young people’s interest in public affairs must be maintained in the  long term by shoring up the online exchange with concrete evidence of  legitimacy. This publication is intended to help meet these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;" />

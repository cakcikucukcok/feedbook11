  <title>Beast - Tiffini Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A little boy who lives in a castle spends his days reading, riding horses, and wandering around his familys estate. On his fifth birthday, the boy bids his parents good-bye as they head for a party; he has no idea that he will never see them again. With his parents deceased in a strange accident, the boy attempts to carry on with the help of his servants. But on the one-year anniversary of his parents deaths, the little boy suddenly transforms into a beast, changing the course of the future forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hundred years later, the Beast is still not used to his new existence; whats more, he is haunted by bizarre dreams of a beautiful lady. As the Beast attempts to determine whether the woman is real, an elderly man stumbles upon the castle during a storm. When he innocently takes a rose from a vase to give to his daughter, the Beast becomes enraged and shows himself, setting off a chain of events that puts the man amid the Beasts desperate quest for happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beast&lt;/i&gt; presents a timeless fairy tale from a new perspective, telling of the beasts relentless search for the enchanting woman he dreams of as he begins to suffer the consequences of uncovering a deadly curse.&lt;/p&gt;" />

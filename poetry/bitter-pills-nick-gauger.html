  <title>Bitter Pills - Nick Gauger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inherent in mans nature is the question of our origin. Many believe that there is something inside of us that compels us to rise above the other species that we live with and have come to term this condition the human soul. It is said to be the piece of us that goes in once life ceases, but does it really exist? Is virtue truly the salt of mankinds character? Or are people simply another creature in love with their notions of a higher order and ideals that they are unfit to achieve? 
Finally with faith being uncertain, is there cause to live a good life and how do we satisfy this compulsion?
This book is a composition of over one hundred poems that ask the questions; does virtue end before humanity can begin? Do people being people undo this very virtue as they deal with the shades of themselves? It will look introspectively at modern society and in poetic prose depict the destruction of a man who attempted to embody honor, respect, and chivalry, morals that seem irrelevant in his time and to his culture. Is he noble? Finally does he earn what he searches for in life or does it change as his time goes on?" />

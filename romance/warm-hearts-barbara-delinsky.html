  <title>Warm Hearts - Barbara Delinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warm Hearts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barbara Delinsky &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEAT WAVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a steamy summer night in Georgetown, and Caroline Cooper is feeling the heat--in more ways than one. Her job, her family, her love life: everything&#39;s reached a boiling point and Caroline needs to cool off. But when she opens her apartment window for air, she finds herself staring at one very hot neighbor on the fire escape across the courtyard. He&#39;s tall, dark, handsome--and as scantily clad as she is. With fifty feet of night separating them, it&#39;s fun to fantasize. But when she finally meets Brendon up-close...&lt;i&gt;that&#39;s when things really heat up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A SPECIAL SOMETHING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;She&#39;s seen him in magazines. Impossibly good-looking. Jaw-droppingly sexy. He&#39;s the most stunning male model Leslie has ever seen. So when her wealthy brother asks what she wants for her birthday, Leslie points to the man in the ad and says, &quot;&lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; Kidding, of course. But the joke is on her when she shows up at her brother&#39;s villa and finds &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. Her fantasy man. In the flesh. Hired to keep Leslie company on an island retreat, Oliver Ames is nothing like the picture-perfect model she imagined. He&#39;s better. Because he&#39;s real--&lt;i&gt;and he&#39;s really falling for her...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

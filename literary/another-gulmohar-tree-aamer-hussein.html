  <title>Another Gulmohar Tree - Aamer Hussein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Usman is visiting post-war London from Pakistan when he meets a young aspiring artist called Lydia who has, like him, come out of an unhappy marriage. Just as the lonely strangers&#39; friendship begins to blossom into something deeper Usman has to return to Karachi, leaving Lydia behind. Two years later, Lydia impulsively abandons her life in London and boards a ship to Karachi, where the two are married. But as the years flit by Usman feels distanced from his life and realises that he hasn&#39;t noticed the buds of the gulmohar tree unfurl. A beautiful account of a marriage that is in turns wry and unashamedly romantic. &#39;We are lucky to have Hussein among us, telling us stories as few can.&#39; Amit Chaudhuri &#39;A lovely, strange, and very moving novel.&#39; Ruth Padel &#39;At its heart it is a story of love, into which Hussein weaves all his remarkable skills of storytelling.&#39; Kamila Shamsie &#39;In his splendid, dreamy Another Gulmohar Tree, Hussein gives us an indelible sense of two worlds - Karachi and London - in miniature and the strong parable of a love story that endures over a lifetime.&#39; Joseph Olshan" />

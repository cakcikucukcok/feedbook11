  <title>A Poisoned Mind - Natasha Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know how you&#39;ve survived at the Bar this long,&quot; Anthony said to Trish. &quot;Caring for your clients to the point of derangement is bad enough; but to start fretting over the opposition. . . . &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the barristers&#39; rule that any suitably quali?ed member of the Bar who is free to take an offered case must do so, QC Trish Maguire can&#39;t quite understand how her head of chambers, Anthony Shelley, can accept a case defending the corrupt Clean World Waste Management company. So when the brilliant and cynical Anthony is nearly killed in an accident, Trish is faced with a painful dilemma: Does she take over the company&#39;s defense, or threaten her hard-won career by refusing to appear in court against Angie Fortwell, the impoverished widow of a hard-working farmer? As Trish delves deeper into the case, she grows more and more troubled by a nagging thought: Was the explosion that killed Angie&#39;s husband really an accident, or the result of sabotage? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this going on at work, the last thing Trish needs is the possibility of explosions at home. Yet she can&#39;t simply walk away from Jay, the clever but damaged fourteen-year-old boy who has attached himself to her family---especially when his mother is found beaten and close to death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brilliant novel of crime and its consequences,&lt;i&gt; A Poisoned Mind&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates the full range of Natasha Cooper&#39;s emotional intelligence and storytelling powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

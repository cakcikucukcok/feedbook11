  <title>Remember to Forget - Sarah Hemli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah was a planned and wanted childa girl, just like her parents had wished for. Born into a nuclear family, stay-at-home mom, a dad working and church planting, grandparents, close friends, and good community, Sarah grew up in a healthy, Christian, and well-liked familyseemingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well into her adult life as a wife and a mother, Sarah held on to that story. She knew that something horrific had happened to her as a child; she just never really remembered. She had resigned herself to not remembering. She had learned to live with the notions of a deep hidden pain, the occasional horrifying image that would come to mind, and the sense of life being only about survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the resignation, she had a faint hope that someday someone would come along and be willing to walk with her in dark places to discover what was hidden and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book invites you to journey with Sarah as she walks through the most challenging time of her adult life. She spent half a lifetime trying to forget what happened to her just to be able to survive. Now she embarks on a journey to face what was hidden and acknowledge the pain that was too strong to feel. It brings her close to letting go of life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With her, you will go to places of disbelief, despair, hopelessness, and grief as Sarah reclaims the lost memories of her childhood and gains herself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarahs account of her journey is honest and raw, sharing her struggles, emotions, and fears. Many e-mails, letters, and pieces of artwork from her journey are included in her story as she shares her battles and road to healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the authority of one who has lived and survived the unthinkable, she tells her story and speaks hope of healing and life to many in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;" />

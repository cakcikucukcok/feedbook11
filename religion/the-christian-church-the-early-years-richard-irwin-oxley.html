  <title>The Christian Church the Early Years - Richard Irwin Oxley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sources of Christian church history, the data on which we rely for our knowledge,are partly divine, partly human. For the history of the apostolic age, until about A.D. 68 or 69, we have the inspired writings of the Old and New Testaments. But after the death of the apostles we have only human authorities, which of course cannot claim to be infallible.  
 We will follow the chronological record of events for the early Christian Church,including dates, places and persons involved from the infancy of John the Baptist to the Death of John. This is the period dating from B.C. 5 or 4 to the Death of The Apostle John which happened in a period between A.D. 98-100. We will also give a detailed account of the Jewish war which started in AD 66 and concluded in AD 73. This includes details of the destruction of the Temple in AD 70." />

  <title>Fruit of the Lemon - Andrea Levy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Andrea Levy, author of &lt;i&gt;Small Island&lt;/i&gt; and winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year and the Best of the Best Orange Prize, comes a story of one woman and two islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith Jackson knows little about her parents&#39; lives before they moved to England. Happy to be starting her first job in the costume department at BBC television, and to be sharing a house with friends, Faith is full of hope and expectation. But when her parents announce that they are moving &quot;home&quot; to Jamaica, Faith&#39;s fragile sense of her identity is threatened. Angry and perplexed as to why her parents would move to a country they so rarely mention, Faith becomes increasingly aware of the covert and public racism of her daily life, at home and at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her parents&#39; suggestion, in the hope it will help her to understand where she comes from, Faith goes to Jamaica for the first time. There she meets her Aunt Coral, whose storytelling provides Faith with ancestors, whose lives reach from Cuba and Panama to Harlem and Scotland. Branch by branch, story by story, Faith scales the family tree, and discovers her own vibrant heritage, which is far richer and wilder than she could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fruit of the Lemon&lt;/i&gt; spans countries and centuries, exploring questions of race and identity with humor and a freshness, and confirms Andrea Levy as one of our most exciting contemporary novelists.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>My Hidden Emotion - Emma Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is ME!
What am I going to do in life?
I want to make my life matter, and I want to be part of a revolution.
I have such big dreams, but sometimes when my mind wanders back to reality the dreams seem to fade.
The older I get and the more decisions I have to make the less I clearly see my purpose within myself.
Sometimes I let desire get in the way of my destiny, and I feel as if my heart speaks a language different from my brain.
I always find myself responsible for something that I cannot control.
I feel so confined within myself when I am lost.
On one side I want to be the leader of my life and the controller of my actions, then on the other I just want somebody to come and tell me to calm down and to make all my choices for me.
This war in my soul has to end soon for my own sake.
Anxiety is a disease that is slowly making my life fold, but now that I have written my rant and resolved this one battle I am at peace.
I feel a lot better than before I started.
Writing is my outlet and in a way my salvation.
To the Lord I pray, Please guide me and shape me into the servant your will seeks for me to be.
Place your hand of protection over me as I find my way back to the dreams that with you I can make into a reality.
In Jesus name
 Amen." />

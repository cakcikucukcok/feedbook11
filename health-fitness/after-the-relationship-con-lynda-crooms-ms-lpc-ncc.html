  <title>After the Relationship Con - Lynda Crooms  Ms  Lpc  Ncc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you been taken advantage of in an intimate relationship? Has
someone used your affection for their selfi sh gain? Do you know
someone who has been taken advantage of because of their affection
for another? If you have experienced a situation like this, After the
Relationship Con is a book that was written for you.
Although con situations have been written about, there is minimal
information for those who have suffered the affects of being conned
within a love relationship. And no one has addressed the serious
emotional issues faced by the victims of relationship cons until now.
After the Relationship Con provides compelling information from a
therapist on how to recognize and heal from the destructive affects
of having been conned in a relationship.
Finally, there is recognition that everyone doesnt just bounce back
when a relationship ends. And when someone feels as though they
have been taken advantage of, there is a deeper level to their pain.
Sometimes we need help moving forward. After the Relationship
Con; How do I Pick up and Move On? provides your answer." />

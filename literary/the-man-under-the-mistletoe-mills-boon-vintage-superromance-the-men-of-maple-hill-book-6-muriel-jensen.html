  <title>The Man Under The Mistletoe (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (The Men of Maple Hill, Book 6) - Muriel Jensen</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;&#39;Tis the season of hope…&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rosie DeMarco is finally climbing out of the grief that locked her heart. Her brother, father and unborn baby died in the span of a week. And no one–not even her husband, Matt–could reach Rosie as she withdrew into darkness. But as her sister&#39;s Christmas wedding draws near, she&#39;s forced to face Matt again…eighteen months after he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matt knows he had to leave. The secret he carried would devastate Rosie. But now someone is out to kill his wife, and Matt wonders if it&#39;s time to reveal all. He can&#39;t bring back the people she loves, but maybe he can give her the gift of hope…and love&#39;s ability to heal.&lt;/p&gt;

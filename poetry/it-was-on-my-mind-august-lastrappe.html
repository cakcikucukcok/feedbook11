  <title>It Was on My Mind - August LaStrappe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The things I write, whats on my mind,
The Holy Spirit talks, and I give him time.
The things I wrote was the way I feel.
At that particular time, it was all for real.
My first poem was about he had nothing to do,
Kids in Joliet prison, and they didnt have a clue.
Life should be about trying to do better.
I started out with Ruthie from the first day I met her.
I went to Africa, and it was supposed to be a thrill,
But the poverty I saw, not in books, it was all for real.
A couple of my poems came with a beat.
I rapped for RL Manaway, and he couldnt stay in his seat.
Ive written poems at funerals and really felt alone.
Love ones and friends, I looked around and they were gone.
Some are a joke just to see you smile.
To see people happy, Ill walk a mile.
Others, about my youth, and theres quite a few.
Im sure you will agree thats my point of view.
All my writings, some people say theyre fine,
The things the Holy Spirit says, whats on my mind." />

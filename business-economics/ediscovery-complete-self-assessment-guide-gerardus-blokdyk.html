  <title>EDiscovery Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do we Lead with EDiscovery in Mind?  in other words, can we track that any EDiscovery project is implemented as planned, and is it working?  Who will be responsible for deciding whether EDiscovery goes ahead or not after the initial investigations?  What are the key elements of your EDiscovery performance improvement system, including your evaluation, organizational learning, and innovation processes?  Does EDiscovery systematically track and analyze outcomes for accountability and quality improvement?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make EDiscovery investments work better.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

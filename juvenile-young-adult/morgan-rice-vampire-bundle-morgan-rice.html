  <title>Morgan Rice: Vampire Bundle - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This bundle includes the first book in two of Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 Bestselling series-THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS and VAMPIRE, FALLEN-all here in one convenient place! This bundle offers a great introduction to Morgan Rice&#39;s fantasy series with over 150,000 words of reading!&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In TURNED (Book #1 of the Vampire Journals), 18 year old Caitlin Paine finds herself uprooted from her nice suburb and forced to attend a dangerous New York City high school. Caitlin suddenly finds herself changing, overcome by a superhuman strength, a sensitivity to light, a desire to feed. She seeks answers to what&#39;s happening to her, and she finds herself in the midst of a vampire war, at the wrong place at the wrong time. Caught between two men as a forbidden love blossoms, she must decide if she will risk both their lives to save humanity, and to be with the one she loves. &lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;TURNED is a book to rival TWILIGHT and VAMPIRE DIARIES, and one that will have you wanting to keep reading until the very last page! If you are into adventure, love and vampires this book is the one for you!&quot; &lt;P&gt;--Vampirebooksite.com &lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In BEFORE DAWN (Book #1 of Vampire, Fallen), Kate, 17, hates her life. An outcast in her own family, who doesn&#39;t understand her, she is hated by her more popular and beautiful sister, and despised by her controlling mother, who favors her sister over her. Kate&#39;s only solace is her friends and her smarts. But even with that, her life seems destined for a dead-end-especially when her mother announces she will have to stay back from college to pay for her sister&#39;s tuition. But one day, all that changes. On her 17th birthday, one of the popular boys falls for her. At the same time, a mysterious new boy, Elijah, arrives at her school, and their connection is undeniable. All seems to be turning her way-when a terrible accident turns her life upside down." />

  <title>Why Monticello? A Utah Memoir - Patricia Wakeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why Monticello? When two Boston women announce their intention to retire to southeastern Utah, their friends are baffled. Where is this place anyway? Do you have family out there? What about the Mormons? Why Monticello? A Utah Memoir tells of their adventures as they try to build a retirement home in what seems a promised land. Join Patricia Wakeley as she describes their love of the mountains, their efforts to buy land, their work with architects and builders, and their new neighbors in the rural town of Monticello, Utah. This memoir carries readers through trials and triumphs, from culture shock and a lost wooden leg to the thrill of spring flowers blooming in the desert. It tells of long-held dreams, the challenges of advancing age, an encounter with fate in Kansas and, always, persistence in seeking their home in the West." />

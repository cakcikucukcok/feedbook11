  <title>The Discovery Field of Quotes - Ehika Joseph Ighodaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In June 2006, I fell into coma. Some doctors took me for dead as they dumped my body on an unmade clinical bed. But after about four days in coma, I shouted, Jesus, save me! Thank you, Father! Soon after, I regained consciousness  but I lost my memory. In 2007, I visited my dads friend, who had taken care of me when I was in coma, to thank him. That night, while I slept in his house, I had a dream. A man came to me in the dream and began to teach me. He said to me, There is a good and a bad in everybody, but those who do evil dont realize this. But you, focus on the good in you and be bold, and you will be a star, a champion. And I awoke. When I awoke, I thought that one of my good characteristics was my ability to write. So, I decided to compile the writings that I started to do as a teenager. I titled the compilation The Discovery Field of Quotes.
This particular work will not only motivate you to get back on your feet if you are down, but it will also show you how to do it. If you are not down, this book will show you how to avoid being down. It is a book that will make a star or champion of anyone who desires to be a star or a champion." />

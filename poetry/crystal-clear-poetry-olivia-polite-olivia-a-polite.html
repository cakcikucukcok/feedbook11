  <title>Crystal Clear Poetry - Olivia Polite, Olivia A. Polite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was close to (15-years) ago, since the LORD healed me 
(MIRACULOUSLY).
I was once in the hospital giving birth to my daughter, then I was
In a (COMA-for 2-months) I thank GOD for my mother,
a STRONG woman of GOD, she kept her FAITH
As she stayed by my Hospital-Bed day after day, Trusting and 
Believing that the LORD would Heal me, as he DID.
In the (year of 1991) my LORD and SAVIOR gave me 
A second chance at LIFE. God then allowed me a new start,
Blessing me with the privilege to once again use my 
MIND and HEART.
He also allowed me the HONOR to PRAISE and WORSHIP his 
Holy name, as I began to live a RIGHTEOUS Life glorifying our
Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST.
I thank and praise the Lord continuously, but most of all strive 
To worship him Faithfully for allowing his child to be.
As I share the words that he instill within me, so that you will have
The opportunity to read GODs POETRY and receive them JOYFULLY.
As I read and receive God Holy Word, I am blessed with the chance
To feed my Heart, Mind and Soul. If you read these scriptures
St. LUKE 8: 40-56,  you may be able to understand how grateful
I am  to my HEAVENLY FATHER.
As he allow me to nap for a little while then he woke me Back -Up and
Said (COME). And I was Obedient and (ROSE) again to do his (WILL)
In my life and to be the mother for my daughters. 
AMEN." />

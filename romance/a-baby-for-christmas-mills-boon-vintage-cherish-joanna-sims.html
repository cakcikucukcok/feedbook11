  <title>A Baby For Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Joanna Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;Other&lt;em&gt; Twin Brother&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marine Captain Luke Brand has come home with one mission on his mind: to make amends with his identical twin brother&#39;s widow. They&#39;ve never gotten along, but for the wounded soldier, establishing a connection with his yet-to-be-born nephew is a top priority–and failure is not an option. Still, he has to make peace without revealing his secret–that he&#39;s madly, completely, head over heels in love with Sophia Lee Brand.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last person Sophia wants to see this Christmas is Luke! She is too vulnerable and, well, too &lt;em&gt;pregnant&lt;/em&gt; for the disruption. So why does she blush when he smiles, or her heart quicken when they touch? His looks are all too familiar–but he stirs up emotions she has never felt before. Perhaps a kiss under the mistletoe will make both of their Christmas wishes come true?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Inspirations of Love - Deborah Kim Blocker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was introduce to the bible as a young child.  My mother always told me the bible was a book of instructions on how to live my life.  As I started reading the bible for myself, I realized it wasn&#39;t only a book of instructions but a book about love, real love; unconditional love.  The more I read the bible, the more i wanted to experience God for myself.  If I needed answers, I&#39;d ask God.  I prayed to him at night, and wrote to him all during the day.  I wrote to him about everything.  I wrote God so many letters that some of my friends asked me if I had a secret love.  After reading over all the  letters I wrote, I found I had written many poems of worship and praise.   I decided at that moment to title this book, &quot;Inspirations of Love&quot;because that is what God is to me.
I want to share with you what he have given me.  I hope you enjoy and be encouraged." />

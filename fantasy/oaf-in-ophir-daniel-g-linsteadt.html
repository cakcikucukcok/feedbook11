  <title>Oaf in Ophir - Daniel G Linsteadt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A highlight of every summer for Emory and his little sister, Faye, was their special annual visit to their grandmother. At Babas house, the kids played by the streams, ate blackberries, watched deer, and ran through the woods to their hearts desire. This summer, Emory was particularly intrigued by the rumor of a magical Oaf living near Baba after discovering his dads Ophir newspaper clippings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emory was alert as he explored the streams and wandered through the woods. A flash of light up the hillside began the magical summer he hoped for. A voice floating through the air, the sound of wood twisting in the trees, and a glimpse of a ragged piece of cloth were the first hints of the Oaf. Baba was delighted by Emorys adventures and urged him to offer a sandwich along with a note to the mysterious being who was revealing itself to Emory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oaf revealed his magic with nature after Emory was mysteriously protected from a mountain lion attack. Baba finally shared her encounters with the irresistible Oaf and his ways in the woods. Tantalizing encounters ensued when Faye arrived and the Oaf slowly befriended the children. The Oaf helped them discover their own personal relationship with nature and their own innate gifts of magic with the plants, trees, and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elusive Oaf sparks the imagination, leaving the reader wishing for more! Captivating from beginning to end, Linsteadt weaves an enchanting lyrical tale of a familys search for innocence and wisdom through their connection to nature.&lt;br /&gt;

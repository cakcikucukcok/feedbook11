  <title>Early Bird Special - Jon Seawright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Linda Hartly was happy with her new life. She had recently relocated to Hollywood, California and found immediate employment as a food server at Scomas restaurant. There she met Sharon, a caring co-worker, with whom she shared rent in the bottom half of a Hollywood Hills home. Linda would gradually start up a relationship with Ken, another waiter at scomas, as she tried to put memories of unpleasant, past experiences behind her, and begin to enjoy her still youthful life. 
She had developed a repertoire with the various employees, including: the demanding head chef Sam; the agonizingly slow-moving, bartender Jimmie, and the unemotional, aloof manager Dan. The Bloombergs were about to come in this evening to request a table in Linds section and order their usual early-bird special. But Linda never showed up for work, as she suddenly started to experience brief periods of blacking out. These moments of memory lose would create horrifying situations for Linda, as she would awake in strange places with no recall of her actions. She manages to conclude that something had to be done. She had to seek professional help.
Across town, lead-Detective Robert Byers was becoming more desperate in solving the case of a possible serial killer. As each murder mounted in numbers, Byers placed more personnel on the case, particularly under-cover agents, to try and catch this assassin, of mostly prostitutes; a killer who dismembered his victims as well.
As his last patient of the day slowly disappeared from sight, psychoanalyst, Dr. David Grossman, withdrew from his side window and sank back into his easy-chair. It temporarily relieved the weight of his heavy body, but the weight of his mental bewilderment continued on. He had become more alarmed, as he now realized that, against all odds, he was possibly treating two cases of multiple- personality disorders at the same time. A doctor of his status would probably not have the occasion to treat just one such case in their entire life time." />

  <title>Feather Castles - Patricia Veryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author of five superbly entertaining Regency novels, &lt;b&gt;Patricia Veryan&lt;/b&gt; has been proclaimed &quot;a worthy successor to Georgette Heyer at her very best&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Chattanooga Times).&lt;/i&gt; Now, in her sixth novel, &lt;i&gt;Feather Castles, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patricia Veryan&lt;/b&gt; gives us another sparkling Regency full of drama and romance as she unfolds the spellbinding adventures and apparently star-crossed love of the soon-to-be-married Miss Rachel Strand and a man whose name she does not even know.&lt;br&gt;It is dusk on the ruined battlefields of Waterloo.  In a carriage slowly making its way across the desolation is Rachel Strand, fiancée to the rich and powerful Claude Sanguinet, who is accompanying her friend and teacher Sister Maria Evangeline in a desperate search for one man among the thousands who lie wounded.  Before they can find that man, they come across a valiant young solider who, though badly wounded, saves them from plunderers-a man who cannot remember his name, or even his nationality.&lt;br&gt;So begins a riveting tale that takes us to both sides of the English Channel, from elegant drawing rooms and a magnificent sinister country estate to riotous taverns and hostelries...&lt;/p&gt;" />

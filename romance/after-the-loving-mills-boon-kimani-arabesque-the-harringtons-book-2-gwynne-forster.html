  <title>After the Loving (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) (The Harringtons, Book 2) - Gwynne Forster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;In the much anticipated follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Once in a Lifetime,&lt;/em&gt; full-figured caterer Velma Brighton is constantly comparing herself to her thin, beautiful sister, Alexis, who seems to have everything. On Alexis&#39;s wedding day, Velma&#39;s insecurity kicks into overdrive when she puts on a formfitting maid-of-honor gown that reveals all of her curves.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Worse still, the man who makes her heart race will be escorting her down the aisle. How will he react to her very shapely physique?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rugged, tough and a loner, Russ Harrington is every woman&#39;s dream. And Velma is his type of woman. He fell for her–beautiful curves and all. But he has little patience with her lack of self-esteem. Setting aside his concerns, Russ pursues Velma…until she tries to undergo a complete makeover. Ironically, Velma&#39;s attempt to attract Russ could cause her to lose the very thing she wants the most–his love.&lt;/p&gt;

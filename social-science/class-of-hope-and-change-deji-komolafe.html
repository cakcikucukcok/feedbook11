  <title>Class of Hope and Change - Deji Komolafe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reclaiming their time. Sharing their lives. Speaking their truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millennials&lt;/strong&gt;, the young people who entered adulthood during the first 18 years of the 21st century, have come of age during one of the most dramatic periods in modern human history. The rapid changes taking place in their individual lives parallel the rapid changes occurring in technology, culture, economics, and politics in societies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past ten years, millennials have been the driving force behind large and small changes across the full spectrum of life. They have built their own seats, created spaces for themselves at the tables of influence, and claimed their places as equal stakeholders in the ongoing project of human civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a lot to say, and we made time to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class of Hope and Change&lt;/strong&gt; captures this moment in history through a series of conversations, conducted over the past two years, with over 50 millennials. This book is an intra-generational conversation among young people who bring a variety of life experiences and cultural perspectives to discussions about a wide range of timely and timeless subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This beautiful movement of love, trust, and truth is rooted in the belief that through conversation, we can discover the gems of wisdom which lie beneath the surface of what we typically see and share on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in the real world is not always pretty, but we think truth can be communicated in love...and we aspire to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick up your copy of the book&lt;/strong&gt;, and join us!&lt;/p&gt;" />

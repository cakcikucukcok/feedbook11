  <title>The Hidden Dance - Susan Wooldridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On March 1st 1933 the luxury liner SS Etoile sets sail from Southampton en route for New York. England has finally emerged from the terrors of the Great War and yet the new optimism in Europe is tempered by the stirring of Hitler&#39;s National Socialists in Germany. Surely another war is unthinkable? On board the liner is Lily Sutton - a fragile but determined woman who is seeking to escape the brutality of her failed marriage, and begin life anew in America. During the five days at sea, Lily is caught between the world she leaves behind, with its attendant riches and position in society, and her new-found love, which has given her the strength and courage to be herself. Travelling in steerage so as not to attract attention, Lily is terrified that her flight from England will be uncovered. But a new friendship makes the journey easier to bear...until an old enemy surfaces and Lily must do everything she can to protect those she loves most in the world." />

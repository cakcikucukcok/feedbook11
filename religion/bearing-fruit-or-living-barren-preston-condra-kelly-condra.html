  <title>Bearing Fruit or Living Barren - Preston Condra, Kelly Condra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we know our lives should be different from the way that we were and different from the world. We know we are to be Christlike, and yet we might wonder, &amp;ldquo;I am still the same me, in the same body, with the same thoughts, wants, and flaws. How can I be genuinely Christlike? WHAT am I to DO?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the most important part of Christian living is not &amp;ldquo;what,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;how,&amp;rdquo; and the answer is to study the letters to the church and believe them? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christian life is a life of faith. The Christian who &amp;ldquo;ceases from his own works as God did from His,&amp;rdquo; and looks to the word of God with faith WILL please God, WILL see change, WILL experience peace, joy, patience, self-control, and much more: he will produce the fruit of the Spirit. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bearing Fruit or Living Barren&lt;/em&gt; explains how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spiritual fruit is spiritual. It is not measured by tasks completed, prayers spoken or services attended. Bearing Fruit or Living Barren details the mindset and characteristics of the &amp;ldquo;spiritual man,&amp;rdquo; the Christian who is productive and pleasing because he is Spirit-filled. He can bear much fruit, benefit the body of Christ, and bring God glory because he allows God to work in him; in regard to Christian living, God does everything for the believer except open the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Down in the Flood - Kenneth Abel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All the top crime writers agree that Kenneth Abel is a spectacular writer: &quot;A gripper all the way,&quot; says Elmore Leonard. &quot;A stunning achievement,&quot; declares James Lee Burke. &quot;Brilliant,&quot; says Robert B. Parker. And now with &lt;i&gt;Down in the Flood&lt;/i&gt;, former New Orleans prosecutor Danny Chaisson is back in a third electrifying thriller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Chaisson&#39;s latest case is bid-rigging. But as his investigation proceeds, a gathering storm named Katrina blasts his world apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by death and the destruction of the city he loves, Danny searches for one man who&#39;d trusted Chaisson to guard his identity when he agreed to testify before a federal grand jury investigating corruption in the city&#39;s construction industry.  But someone has leaked the identity of this crucial witness, and as the city begins to empty before the approaching storm, Danny learns that a pair of corrupt policemen hired by the wealthy defendants in the case have begun stalking his client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut off from escape, and unsure whom he can trust, Chaisson&#39;s client has gone into hiding in the city&#39;s Ninth Ward, where he grew up. Now Danny must race against time, a pair of relentless professional killers, and the rising flood waters to save the man who&#39;d counted on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can Danny save one man as a whole city dies?&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="After a row with her mother, Kathryn collects her belongings and slams the door for the final time. It&#39;s 1974 and the beginning of a new life - but how much can Kathryn really leave behind? She takes a live-in job as a waitress at a country house, working alongside the outrageous Dee-Dee. Both 17, and both with their own tragic past, they learn how to bag a bloke, get through testing times and even how to get on the property ladder. A Young Woman&#39;s Guide to Carrying On is a tender, witty and wise novel of love, adultery, second chances and questionable parenting.  Heart-warming and heart breaking in equal measure." />

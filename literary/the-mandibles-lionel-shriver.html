  <title>The Mandibles - Lionel Shriver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With dry wit and psychological acuity, this near-future novel explores the aftershocks of an economically devastating U.S. sovereign debt default on four generations of a once-prosperous American family. Down-to-earth and perfectly realistic in scale, this is not an over-the-top &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; tale. It is not science fiction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2029, the United States is engaged in a bloodless world war that will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Overnight, on the international currency exchange, the &amp;#8220;almighty dollar&amp;#8221; plummets in value, to be replaced by a new global currency, the &amp;#8220;bancor.&amp;#8221; In retaliation, the president declares that America will default on its loans. &amp;#8220;Deadbeat Nation&amp;#8221; being unable to borrow, the government prints money to cover its bills. What little remains to savers is rapidly eaten away by runaway inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their ninety-seven-year-old patriarch dies.

An expat author, their aunt, Nollie, returns from abroad at seventy-three to a country that&amp;#8217;s unrecognizable. Her brother, Carter, fumes at caring for their demented stepmother, now that an assisted living facility isn&amp;#8217;t affordable.

Thus it is necessarily about bitterness, rivalry, and selfishness&amp;#8212;but also about surreal generosity, sacrifice, and transformative adaptation to changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />

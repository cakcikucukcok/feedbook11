  <title>Picture Perfect #5: All Together Now - Cari Simmons, Laura J. Burns, Cathi Mingus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being one half of a BFF heart necklace is serious business&amp;#8212;and in the Picture Perfect series, each story tackles a tough friendship challenge. Through the ups and downs of life in middle school, through braces and boy bands, family feuds and fashion disasters, your best bud is there. But what happens when friendship suddenly gets complicated? Tween readers will adore these sweet, accessible stories about the power of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gracie Hardwick has always wondered what it would be like to have siblings&amp;#8212;which is why she is so excited to go skiing with her best friend, Mari, and Mari&amp;#39;s big, boisterous family. It is sure to be an amazing weekend spent riding the chairlift, building snowmen, and drinking hot chocolate with Mari and her brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about siblings, though, is that they are always around . . . even when you need alone time with your BFF to talk about things like your secret crush. And Mari is too busy racing her brothers down the slopes, racing her brothers to the car, racing her brothers to see who can finish their dessert first to notice that Gracie really needs some one-on-one time. In fact, it sort of feels like Mari cares more about beating her brothers in the latest competition than hanging out with her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everything in Mari&amp;#39;s house is a high-stakes contest, how can Gracie compete for her best friend&amp;#39;s attention?&lt;/p&gt;" />

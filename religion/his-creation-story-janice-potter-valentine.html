  <title>His Creation Story - Janice Potter Valentine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how the universe and earth began? How did the plants, animals, and people get here? Who made me? You may have heard that we evolved. How could something so intricate have evolved?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;His Creation Story, by Janice Valentine, is a beautiful picture of the simplicity of Gods plan for His universe. It is obvious that the book is a result of Janices passion for the beauty of Gods redemption story, which begins in creation and climaxes with an empty tomb.&lt;br /&gt;
Chris Russell, MDiv, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Internation Mission Board missionary in Moldova&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Valentines book, His Creation Story, is a precious way of sharing about Gods work on our planet, the planet He created, and how He resolved mankinds problem. The pictures and poems give added emphasis to this wonderful story. The poem If I Could See What God Sees has to be one of my very favorite poems. Thanks for sharing in this way, Janice!&lt;br /&gt;

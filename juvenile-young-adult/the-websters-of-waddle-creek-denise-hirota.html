  <title>The Websters of Waddle Creek - Denise Hirota</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wendell Webster is a little duck in a big family that lives next to Waddle Creek. Even though he loves his parents and brothers and sisters, they are very noisy and take up a lot of room in the nest. Wendells next-door neighbors, the Perquackys, are even louder! More than anything in the world, Wendy wishes he could go off on his and be his own duck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day after Wendells mother says he is big enough to explore by himself, he waddles past Pink Ladys house and down the road. At first, it is peaceful and quiet. But it is not long before little Wendell gets lonelyand then lost! As it grows darker and darker, Wendell tries hard to be a brave duck, even though he has no idea how he will ever get back home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful childrens story, a little duck embarks on a daring adventure where he finds a new appreciation for his loud family and neighbors in Waddle Creek.&lt;/p&gt;" />

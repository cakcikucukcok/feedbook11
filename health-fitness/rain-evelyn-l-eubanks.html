  <title>Rain - Evelyn L. Eubanks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sun in the sky is a star for Christ and the Moon is a star for His wife, they split the work, He does day and she does night.  The Sons will is to have life and love and it is light but the Son has a plan and it is only to show you His hand, the Moon above.  The Moon is His sound and heartbeat, she only stands by His voice.  The Son and Moon is only one light, the only light in space and the Sons voice holds the Moon above in place at all times because she is above corruption.  The Moon is bright and her mind glows, the Moon is a night light so man can see in the dark and only the Son can move her around.  The one thing Christ holds above man is the rain and you will get water if the Moon cries.  The Moon is moving to the Promised Land because man walked on.  The Promised Land is located in space over another ground but can man find it." />

The problem was that Dave Tanning owned the town and most of the surrounding land. Indeed, the whole Tanning family didn&#39;t take kindly to strangers ranching land they felt they owned.  At first Everyone laughed at the thought of someone thinking they could access the valley surrounded by mountains and enormous rock walls. Many had tried. Many had died.

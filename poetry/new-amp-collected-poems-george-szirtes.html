  <title>New &amp;amp; Collected Poems - George Szirtes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;George Szirtes came to Britain as an eight-year-old refugee after the Hungarian uprising in 1956.&amp;amp;#160; Educated in England, he trained as a painter, and has always written in English. This comprehensive retrospective of his work covers poetry from over a dozen collections written over four decades, with a substantial gathering of new poems. It was published on his 60th birthday in 2008 at the same time as the first critical study of his work, &quot;Reading George Szirtes&quot; by John Sears. Haunted by his family&#39;s knowledge and experience of war, occupation and the Holocaust, as well as by loss, danger and exile, all of Szirtes&#39; poetry covers universal themes: love, desire and illusion; loyalty and betrayal; history, art and memory; humanity and truth. Throughout his work there is a conflict between two states of mind, the possibility of happiness and apprehension of disaster. These are played out especially in his celebrated&lt;BR&gt;long poems and extended sequences, &quot;The Photographer in Winter&quot;, &quot;Metro&quot;, &quot;The&lt;BR&gt;Courtyards&quot;, &quot;An English Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Reel&quot;, all included here.&lt;/div&gt;" />

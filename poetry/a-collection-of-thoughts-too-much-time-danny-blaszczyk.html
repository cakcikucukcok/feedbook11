  <title>A Collection of Thoughts &amp; Too Much Time! - Danny Blaszczyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Collection of Thoughts and Too Much Time is simply that: a collection of thoughts and too much time! 
I would like to be clever, but I am not.  I would like to be talented, but I am not.  I would like to be wealthy, but it will never happen. I just simply exist in much the same way as everyone else and I see and experience what others do.  Yet life is simply a series of snapshots, with each snap a particular event.  I have tried to capture some of these events, not using a camera or mobile phone, but rather, to express my feelings and thoughts about them.  Clearly, I have also had far too much time on my hands!
I dedicate this collection to my family, because they are long suffering.  I particularly dedicate this work to my grandchildren, as some of this is about them and some of this is a reaction to the world I see them growing up in.
I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this work and that, in some manner, it sparks thought and debate.
Thank you," />

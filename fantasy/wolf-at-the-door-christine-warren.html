  <title>Wolf At the Door - Christine Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sullivan Quinn didn&#39;t travel 3,000 miles from his native Ireland and his wolf pack just to chase rabidly after the most delectable quarry he&#39;s ever seen. Quinn is in America on a mission--to warn his Other brethren of a shadowy group willing to use murder and mayhem to bring them down. But one whiff of this Foxwoman&#39;s delicious honeysuckle fragrance and he knows that she is more than a colleague or a conquest...she is his mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropologist Cassidy Poe is a world-renowned authority on social interaction, but the overpowering desire she feels around Quinn defies every ounce of her expertise. Working by his side to uncover The Others&#39; enemies poses risks she never expected--to her own safety, to those she loves, and to her heart, as every encounter with Quinn proves more blissfully erotic than the last...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with no one to trust but each other, Quinn and Cassidy face a foe that&#39;s edging closer every day, threatening to destroy the life they&#39;ve always known, and the passion they&#39;ve just discovered...&lt;/p&gt;" />

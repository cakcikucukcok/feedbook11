  <title>Cured - Jeffrey M.D. Rediger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When it comes to disease, who beats the odds&lt;/b&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to spontaneous healing, skepticism abounds. Doctors are taught that &quot;miraculous&quot; recoveries are flukes, and as a result they don&#39;t study those cases or take them into account when treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter Dr. Jeff Rediger, who has spent over 15 years studying spontaneous healing, pioneering the use of scientific tools to investigate recoveries from incurable illnesses. Dr. Rediger&#39;s research has taken him from America&#39;s top hospitals to healing centers around the world--and along the way he&#39;s uncovered insights into why some people beat the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Cured&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Rediger digs down to the root causes of illness, showing how to create an environment that sets the stage for healing. He reveals the patterns behind healing and lays out the physical and mental principles associated with recovery: first, we need to physically heal our diet and our immune systems. Next, we need to mentally heal our stress response and our identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through rigorous research, Dr. Rediger shows that much of our physical reality is created in our minds. Our perception changes our experience, even to the point of changing our physical bodies--and thus the healing of our identity may be our greatest tool to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, miracles only contradict what we know of nature at this point in time. &lt;i&gt;Cured &lt;/i&gt;leads the way in explaining the science behind these miracles, and provides a first-of-its-kind guidebook to both healing and preventing disease.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Tombstone, Two - M Missy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SUMMARY:
What can I say about how my life has turned out compared as to what I had expected when my dad told us that we were moving to Tombstone, Arizona?
I expected to have a Dad who was a mining engineer and my Mom and I and my two sisters to run the ranch just like we did back in Pennsylvania. We were a very close family that got along great and had a deep love for one another. Life was perfect.
However, not in Tombstone for a week, my Dad and my Mom and my sister Amy were shot to death during a stage coach robbery by Johnny Ringo and two of his friends. My loving family was gone in 10 minutes for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The only family I had left was my sister Christy. 
So, Christy and I moved into our big new ranch house along with Miss Stern, my English Governess and Sofia; the young girl that was given to me as a present from the great Geronimo for not killing his two sons when I had the chance during our wagon train trip.
I still expected to get my schooling from Miss Stern and I still expected to run the ranch. However, Miss Stern had other plans for me as she turned my into the houses sissy maid instead.
Yes, instead of being the ranch Forman, I became the first sissy maid of Tombstone, Arizona.
Miss Stern taught me to behave the old English way; thru petticoat punishment and her cane.
In spite of my maid status, I still had to kill 13 men in the last six months with my gun handling skills in order to keep my new family save. 
It was not the life I was expecting, but as time moved along, it was not turning out to be such a bad life after all." />

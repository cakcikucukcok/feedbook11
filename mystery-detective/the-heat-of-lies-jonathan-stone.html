  <title>The Heat of Lies - Jonathan Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Young, beautiful, police detective Julian Palmer is growing up. Just a few years out of the New York Police Academy, she&#39;s earning her stripes fast. Julian has solved high profile murder cases, and been promoted to Lieutenant upstate Troy, New York. But her latest case has her baffled. She&#39;s tracking the killer of a respected husband and father. With no suspects, a family hungry for answers, and the press breathing down her neck, Julian is desperate and in over her head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s when Julian gets an unlikely visitor: her one time mentor and the first man she arrested for murder, former police Chief Winston &quot;The Bear&quot; Edwards. Once famed for his physical immensity and unmatched detective skills, Edwards is now a shadow of his former self. He&#39;s managed to escape a life in prison, but emerged a beaten man with no family and nowhere to turn. The only thing he has left is his brilliant police mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the one time mentor has returned to his former student, looking for a shot at redemption, and a reason for living. Despite Julian&#39;s mistrust and fear of Edwards, the young Lieutenant knows he&#39;s still a gifted detective and cautiously brings him in on this seemingly unsolvable case. Working side by side with a man who once tried to kill her, Julian gets drawn deep into the murder investigation-and into the mind of the murder victim&#39;s young daughter. The girl forces Julian to confront once again the bizarre events surrounding the decade old murder of her own father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taut, edgy and utterly unpredictable, &lt;i&gt;The Heat of Lies&lt;/i&gt; will shock and scare you and keep you turning the pages long into the night. Jonathan Stone is widely praised as one of today&#39;s top thriller writers. Stone knows the importance of character, the significance of nuance, and folly of cliché. This is his second, and most riveting novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="Does anyone truly know what a vampire should look or act like? If you are drawn into the folkloric accounts and want to expand your knowledge, then take a seat and prepare for a lifetime of events. By the end of the tale you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d not sat down to talk or listen to strangers. This narrator shares the trade secrets of his circle and many would have had him expelled long ago for it but they are fearful of his impending wrath. He is the Light and the Darkness. Perfectly balanced, he can and will be tempted to wage his curiosities towards the Good or Bad and use unfair tactics to reach supremacy over all that lives or shouldn&#39;t. He will without doubt, ascend to his foreseen position as the Ultimate Beast. Even if it means lying his way to the top.
You can follow his journey every step of the way. Learning for yourself, the ups and downs of becoming, or how to destroy a vampire for your own freedom of fear." />

  <title>Strong, My Love - Peter Fallon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Care, company, community have been fundamental concerns of Peter Fallon&#39;s writing in and about the world, care for people and place, for planet earth and the poetry of earth, for the values espoused in Virgil&#39;s Georgics which he has translated . . . and the seriousness of that caretaking has developed over the years to a point where the artistic and the moral have converged. — Seamus Heaney, June 2010 At the heart of Strong, My Love, Peter Fallon&#39;s first collection in seven years, is a series of prayers for his daughter and son and for their generation.

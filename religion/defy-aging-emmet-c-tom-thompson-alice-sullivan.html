  <title>Defy Aging - Emmet C. (Tom) Thompson, Alice Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Good health doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the age-old magic potion which doctors and nutritionists have attempted to conjure up since the beginning of time – the perfect balance of mind and health. It’s the perfect blend of nutrition and exercise. With countless diets and workout plans sweeping the nation, it can be difficult to find which ones are legitimate, let alone the one that is the most beneficial to you. The truth is there is no magic potion. Dr. Jacob Rosenstein has analyzed modern diet through years of his personal experience. These experiences enabled him to create a comprehensive and effective method toward improving an individual’s health and lifelong wellness. His findings reflect the rewards of his personal nutrition and supplement regime, along with his exercise program. These discoveries have transformed his life, and can help transform yours. It is what we eat and how we exercise that can create a life full of vitality. With extensive research, Dr. Rosenstein provides us with his knowledge of good nutrition, correct supplements, and what you can do to promote your good health and longevity - making the rest of your life the best of your life." />

  <title>Did She Fall? - Thorne Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This early work by Thorne Smith was originally published in 1930. James Thorne Smith, Jr. was an American author who specialized in supernatural fantasy fiction under the byline Thorne Smith. „Did She Fall? ” (1930) is a straight murder mystery whose dialogue shows occasional traces of Smith’s wisecracking energy. America’s bawdiest, wittiest writer turns his talents to a startling novel of murder, suspense and brilliant detection. Welcome to the Crewe house, where it is one for all and all for one. Unless, of course, you are the beautiful blonde, Emily-Jane. When she was bad, she was very, very bad, and when she was good, she was luscious until somebody killed her, or did she fall? So many would-be murderers, but only one would get to her first. Who will win out in the end?" />

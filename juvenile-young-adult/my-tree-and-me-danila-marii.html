  <title>My Tree and Me - Danila Marii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A gentle and colorful world of rainbows, magical trees, and guardian animals invites readers to travel afar in order to go within. Inspired by yoga and meditation, this intuitive book speaks to the hearts of even the youngest of readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danila Marii must have been covered in a cloud of magical dust or overcome by a wave of Shakti (yogas creative energy) while writing My Tree and Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words, shapes, and brilliant colors appear to pour onto the page deep from within, giving life to an enchanted tale of each individuals soulful journey of self-discovery. This book is not solely dedicated to children, but it also relates something precious to adults who allow themselves to be lead back to their true essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading the book, I imagine children leafing through the pages, playing, and jumping inside every colorful image. I see adults engaging with their childs emotions, joining them on a guided journey that envelopes their senses and expands their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe this book to be so very profound, yet so gentle as to interact on so many levels and dimensions. It tackles important issues without becoming overwhelming, instead playfully involving the reader in a mysterious and joyful game. Every child (and inner child) will approach life with more awareness, serenity, truth, and courage after having read My Tree and Me.&lt;/p&gt;

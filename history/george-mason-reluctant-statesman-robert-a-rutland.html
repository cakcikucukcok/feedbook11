  <title>George Mason: Reluctant Statesman - Robert A. Rutland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;George Mason of Gunston Hall was a scholarly craftsman of government during America&#39;s crucial formative years. His Virginia Declaration of Rights provided a sense of purpose and direction to the rebellious colonies, and his vigorous insistence on the protection of personal liberties in the Constitution is reflected in the document&#39;s first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights. Fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson said of Mason that he &quot;was of the first order of greatness.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Few Americans who have served their country, however, have met with as little recognition. Essentially a private person who cared nothing for political prestige, Mason had been overshadowed by the other founders of the Republic -- although most of them had turned to him for advice and direction. In a concise, cogently written biography, a distinguished historian restores the &quot;reluctant statesman&quot; to his proper place in the pantheon of America&#39;s greatest citizens.&lt;/p&gt;" />

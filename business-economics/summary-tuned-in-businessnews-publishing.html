      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The must-read summary of Craig Stull, Phil Meyers and David Meerman Scott&#39;s book: &quot;Tuned In: Uncover the Extraordinary Opportunities that Lead to Business Breakthroughs&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This complete summary of the ideas from Craig Stull, Phil Meyers and David Meerman Scott&#39;s book &quot;Tuned In&quot; shows that there&#39;s no use developing new products in isolation and hoping they will sell. A better idea is to find overlooked marketplace problems which already exist. Solve those problems for people and you’ll have no issue finding willing customers who won’t need to be coerced into buying. Real success in the marketplace is not based on creativity or even on clever marketing. Instead, you need to develop products that resonate with people. In their book, the authors explain the six-step &quot;Tuned In Process&quot; that you can use to get tuned in and develop the products that customers really want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;• Save time&lt;br&gt;• Understand key concepts&lt;br&gt;• Expand your knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;Tuned In&quot; and discover why you should get tuned in to your business and develop products that solve real problems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

&lt;B&gt;Sarah, a Mom and Book Lover, 11/20/2006&lt;/B&gt;   from www.BarnesandNoble.com...&lt;B&gt;Kids will love it!&lt;/B&gt;  This book will keep little minds positively engaged in a fun way. It will encourage young readers to use their imagination and explore through reading. The book is nicely illustrated with bright color combinations that make the story and characters 
come alive. It has an easy rhythm and flow. You could easily create a sing along while 
reading this book. Children will want to turn the pages to see what happens next. 
They will surely want Magical Marty to be their friend too!

&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Cute story.  Appeals to the childs imagination. Fun and playful.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Well done.  Illustrations are believable and bring the story to life.  I can see my nephew through this book.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Magical Marty in Space is in the fun room and helps kids use their imagination and travel in space!
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Nice job - A great bedtime story!  I like that its educational for (Whats Orion? ), sparking curiosity even more!
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Informative and imaginative all in oneExcellent!
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The wording and illustration are matched very well.&quot;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Magical Marty is a fun thing to have in mind when you fall asleep.  I would get this for our grandson.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The author presented a great value of friendship in a very creative way.  The verbs and the adjectives enhanced the magical value of the book.

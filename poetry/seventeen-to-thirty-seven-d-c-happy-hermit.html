  <title>Seventeen to Thirty-Seven - D.C. Happy Hermit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection of poems,there are some inspired by grief, some by love, one by a three-wheeler, my first car, and some just about thoughts and feelings.  The first poem was written at the age of seventeen, the most recent, at the age of 37!  When my nan died of lung cancer after a long battle, I found some way of expressing my emotions through writing poetry.  Since then, my life has had many twists and turns but somehow, even after being diagnosed with thyroid disease and some sort of Bi-polar, I have settled down and decided to present my poems to anyone that finds them interesting. A friend of mine recently said that she enjoys reading the poems, as they make you think about things in a very different way. Maybe - sometimes life needs a &#39;flip-side&#39;!" />

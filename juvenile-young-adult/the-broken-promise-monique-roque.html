  <title>The Broken Promise - Monique Roque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Broken Promise is a story of two individuals whose love for each another makes one of them break the pact he has made with himself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Jean Ireland is on a week-long vacation and she intends to enjoy it to the fullest. It is the much needed break for her hectic days as a teacher, and she hopes that the ranch where she has reserved a place to stay will provide her with the peace and relaxation she direly needs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It turns out that Aaron Cesars ranch is more than anything Jean has imagined it to be. From the moment she steps inside the house, she immediately feels a strong sense of belongingness. Meeting David, Aarons son, only makes Jean want to stay at the ranch for good even more. David is just as attracted to Jean, but he has made a promise with himself that he will not get involved with their guests.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With each day that passes by, David finds himself getting more and more drawn to Jean. Both are aware of how strongly they feel for one another, and how one promise keeps them apart.....&lt;/P&gt;" />

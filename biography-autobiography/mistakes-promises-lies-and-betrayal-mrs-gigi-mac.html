  <title>Mistakes, Promises, Lies and Betrayal - Mrs. GiGi Mac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How did I get here? Is this part of the plan or am I on candied camera. Im waiting on someone top pop out and say you have been PUNKED..  In my world where
I live at you cant fall asleep in your car because a drunk cop may shot you. You have to sit outside with your kids or they may see a gay dude running around naked on wet. Throwing shitty pads on top of cars and rubbing his privates on the ground. In my world cps has more power than the feds. In my world your friends get shot for having an opinion and a voice.  Our system has some times unknowingly thrown an innocent person in jail. Then theres times when they throw bogus charges on you.  If you let them they will try in beat you down mentally or physically. To a point where you cant take it any more and you either give up or fight harder to survive. Our great leaders who really wanted to make a change got shot, set up or sent to jail for life.  So tell me how I got here divorced after 17 years of marriage and 4 kids. In the process I loose a 3 bedroom house with a two car garage a backyard and four dogs. 
How did I get here with a man that lives such a mysterious life that I dont even know if hes married, just have a lot of women, or on crack.  If not all of them put together. He just doesnt know that I am tired of his senior citizen excuses.  Oh baby Im tired, my back hurt, my high blood pressure.  I just be sitting there like damn  I know your tongue work.  Oh yea I forgot to tell you my fourth childs father Wilbert is bought fifty years old. My first three childrens father, Lawrence is the same age as me but he act kind of, well we gone call it special, sometimes. The crazy thing about it is the more you let a man chase you, and play by your rules and not his, the more they love and respect you.  The moment you make it all about them they loose interest.  Love is crazy it affects your heart and your brain.  I keep waiting for someone to wake me up.  I just found out my mom only has two weeks to live according to the doctor. Shes been having cancer for the past fifteen years but only found out seven years ago because of a car wreck.  Its only the grace of god shes still here for this long.  Every day she gets weaker and weaker.  It breaks my heart to see her like this.  Lord please be with my family we just lost an uncle." />

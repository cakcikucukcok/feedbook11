  <title>My Stories and I&#39;m Still Sticking to Them! - Tom Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some folks will often ask Tom what his columns in that Wisconsin newspaper are all about.  He will answer, Do you mean the one in the Fennimore Times, called FennimoreAs I remember?As though there were any other. Then he will respond: &lt;br&gt;
Oh, I write about a special place, friends and neighbors, happy times what ever. Like   swimming pools and pool halls, town constables and chiefs. City parks, paper routes, pastors, parsons and priests.&lt;br&gt;
I wont forget town and country schools and dedicated teachers there within. With tales of playground hi-jinksall to make you grin.&lt;br&gt; 
The old places called a Blacksmith Shop, Gus shoeing horses at the open door. Fred Doan the Harness maker, Bill Buri, Wagon builderthese craftsmen are no more.&lt;br&gt;
The Fenway Theater packed with kids, admission one thin dime. A Friday double feature Roy, Gene and Hopalong, cowboys for all time. &lt;br&gt;
There are neighborhoods and life long friends, creameries making cheese. Sparkys Saturday night dances, May I have this waltzPlease?&lt;br&gt; 
 I claim my stories are but true, as best I can remember. And many do agree, but others shout Not in April, twas in November!&lt;br&gt;
 Best of all, even strangers come to me and say, I know this place and the stories that you tell. Just change the names, for then youll seeFennimores my hometown as well.&lt;br&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="MY BOOK IS BASED ON HOPE &amp; THE INVITATION
THE INVITATION...COME TO CHRIST
(Rev.3:20,21)
HOPE... COME AS YOU ARE; BROKEN BUT NOT FORSAKEN
Each poem you are about to read reveal struggles I dealt with throughout
my journey, but what visions of Glory I was shown in between the
stepping stones of life as my mind continued to be renewed. (Eph. 4:23,
24). We become a New Creature in Christ but we make many mistakes
along the way. Do not be discouraged. We are all imperfect in the fl esh,
but look to His Holy Spirit to guide you to a higher place in your spirit,
where you will begin to see a New You! Once youre Born Again in Christ
you become Born of His Spirit. (John 3:3) Through His Amazing
Grace, your sins are covered by His blood He shed for All Mankind.
(John 3:16-18) Jesus Loves You!
YOU ARE NOT ALONE
YOU ARE FORGIVEN; YOU ARE SET FREE" />

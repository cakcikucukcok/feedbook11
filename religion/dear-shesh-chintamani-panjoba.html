  <title>Dear Shesh, Chintamani - Panjoba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all are manav man. Our ancestor is Manu. We all belong to the same family; therefore, in Bharat, we all believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. Priyavrat had distributed the seven continents among his sons, and all their progeny is spread over everywhere. Deep studies show similarities in languages and names of weekdays, their meanings, and relations. The whole world is one family. The Bible, Koran, Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagwat all guide us to become great human beings. Manu and Manu-Shatrupa, his wife, decided to go in search of him after living full, glorious lives. Efforts made and consequences are described in Ramcharitmanas by Tulsidas. Knowledge of Hindi language helps us, but the whole life is short to study and grasp Ramcharitmanas. And every day becomes pleasant in trying to do it. There are millions of people in India. We find them devoting themselves for it, and several are making it their career, earning a lot from it. It actually tells us how to lead ones life." />

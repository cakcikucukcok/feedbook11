  <title>Peer Gynt -  Henrik Ibsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henrik Ibsen wrote &amp;quot;Peer Gynt&amp;quot; in 1867. He never intended that the work be performed on stage; instead, Ibsen envisioned his work as a poetic fantasy to be read. However, &amp;quot;Peer Gynt&amp;quot; quickly became recognised as a masterwork of Scandinavian literature, and in 1876, Ibsen adapted his work for the stage. &amp;quot;Peer Gynt&amp;quot; is the most well known Norwegian play throughout history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among the masterpieces of world literature, this early verse drama by the celebrated Norwegian playwright humorously yet profoundly explores the virtues, vices, and follies common to all humanity &amp;mdash; as represented in the person of Peer Gynt, a charming but irresponsible young peasant. Based on Norwegian folklore and Ibsen&amp;rsquo;s own imaginative inventions, the play relates the roguish life of the world-wandering Peer, who finds wealth and fame &amp;mdash; but never happiness &amp;mdash; although he is redeemed by love in the end. As a play, &amp;quot;Peer Gynt&amp;quot; consists almost entirely as a vehicle for Peer&amp;#39;s adventures. He is a character who runs from commitment, and who is completely selfish, having little concern for the sacrifices that others are forced to make in accommodating him. Ibsen&amp;#39;s use of satire and a self-centered protagonist suggests social implications for nineteenth-century society, a topic that always interested Ibsen." />

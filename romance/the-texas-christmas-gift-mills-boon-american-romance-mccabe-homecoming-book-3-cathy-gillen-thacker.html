  <title>The Texas Christmas Gift (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (McCabe Homecoming, Book 3) - Cathy Gillen Thacker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A home for the holidays—that’s a pretty tall order, with Christmas only a few weeks away. But venture capitalist and single father Derek McCabe never takes no for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And he’s certain that Eve Loughlin is just the Realtor to find a house for him and his young daughter. Derek needs more than shelter, though. Being with Eve makes him aware of all he’s missing: Love, companionship, and a beautiful woman to share his life. Eve is all business, but there’s no denying the attraction that keeps bringing them together long after the contract is signed. Derek knows just what he wants. Can he get past that cool exterior and make her his own Christmas Eve?&lt;/p&gt;

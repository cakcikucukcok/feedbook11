  <title>What Are You Looking at Bitch? - Mohsen El-guindy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel is a love story between Hashem, a business magnate from the Middle East, and Angela, a rich American woman running a company she inherited from her father. Angela was asexual and lacked sexual inclinations toward men. She was jealous and arrogant and inherited from her father his tough nature and foul mouth. When she got mad, she would attack her opponents with offensive words. She also suffered from a neurological disorder. When she got nervous, her right hand would shake involuntarily.
A financial crisis took Angelas company to the ground, and she was forced to put it up for sale in the market with a cheap price. Hashem, who also invests in buying ruined companies, heard about her crisis and came to buy her out. Angela suddenly found herself strongly attracted to Hashem, and they fell in love with each other and got married. Angela gave birth to a girl they called Aisha and a boy they called Amr. The river of life glided along beautifully between them until Hashems past reared its ugly head and destroyed their marriage. 
Countess Adelle von Vetsera, Hashems ex-mistress, who lost her mind when Hashem married Angela, came to take back her love. The two women quarreled over Hashem. In one of her furious quarrels with Hashem, Angela rushed to her car. Her daughter, Aisha, rushed into the passenger seat, yelling at her not to drive. Angela ploughed the car right into a trailer. Angela was the only survivor in the car, and Aisha died. Angela faced charges of being drunk behind the wheel and killing her daughter. She was sentenced to three years in prison.
Hashem refused to live with Angela any longer and returned to his first love, Adele. Adele gave birth to a baby girl and called her Aisha to please Hashem. Adele died from cancer. Hashem, however, refused to return to Angela, and being long forsaken made her emotional status grow rapidly worse. Years of abandonment passed, and Hashem returned to Angela in the end on the condition that she must behave and stop uttering dirty words. She accepted wholeheartedly. But did she fulfill her promise? This is what the novel tells." />

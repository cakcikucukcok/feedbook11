  <title>The Code of Putinism - Brian D. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is Vladimir Putin up to?  This book shows how the mentality of Putin and his team - the code of Putinism - has shaped Russian politics over the past two decades.  It explains not only the thoughts and ideas that motivate Putin&#39;s decisions, but also the set of emotions and habits that influence how Putin and his close allies view the world.
The code of Putinism has powerfully shaped the nature of Russia&#39;s political system, its economy, and its foreign policy. Taylor draws on a large number of interviews, the speeches of Putin and other top officials, and the Russian media to analyze the mentality of Team Putin.  Key features of Russian politics today -- such as authoritarianism, Putin&#39;s reliance on a small group of loyal friends and associates, state domination of the economy, and an assertive foreign policy - are traced to the code of Putinism.  Key ideas of the code include conservatism, anti-Americanism, and the importance of a state that is powerful both at home and abroad.  Dominant habits of Putin and his associates include control, order, and loyalty.  Important feelings driving Russia&#39;s rulers include the need for respect, resentment about lost status and mistreatment by the West, and vulnerability.
While some observers portray Putin as either a cold-blooded pragmatist or a strident Russian nationalist, Taylor provides a more nuanced and compelling interpretation of Putin&#39;s motives and actions.  &lt;em&gt;The Code of Putinism&lt;/em&gt; also shows how Putin&#39;s choices, guided by this mentality, have led to a Russia that is misruled at home and punching above its weight abroad." />

  <title>Bethink Rabbi Benjamin Schultz - Julius Herscovici</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story encapsulates the struggle and legacy of Rabbi Benjamin Schultz. All his life, Rabbi Schultz was a strong critic of Communism. Even his foes, detractors, and a chorus of anti-Schultz people never questioned the sincerity of his position against Communism.
				In the United States as well as in Europe, many intellectuals viewed the criticism of Communism and the Soviet Union as nonobjective and a biased intellectual exercise. In an era in which Communism was viewed in many of the intelligentsia quarters as a benign philosophy that could offer many positive solutions, Rabbi Schultz was an exception. Rabbi Benjamin Schultz arrived at his anticommunist convictions by researching the state of Soviet Jewry. He concluded that the Soviet law against anti-Semitism was a paper shellgood for propaganda outside the Soviet Union but not a protecting shield for the Jews living in the Soviet Union. The power of the law of anti-Semitism was null." />

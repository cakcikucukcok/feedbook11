  <title>Forever Yours - Sally McGuire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the outside, Saline Summers appears to have the perfect life. She is a renowned fashion designer, owner of an exclusive boutique on the Upper East Side, fiance of New York Citys popular mayor, Sebastian OReilly, and mother to their beautiful little girl. But what no one knows is that on the inside, Saline is living a personal hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past four years, Saline and her daughter, Ariel, have been enduring abuse and blackmail at the hands of Sebastian, a master manipulator with powerful friends. The only thing that has kept Saline going through it all is her desire to be with her first love, Lex Banks, again. As Saline and her best friend, Lucy, contemplate how she can safely leave Sebastian once and for all, Lex returns to New York City on a business trip and personal mission: to profess his undying love for Saline. When their paths finally cross, Saline must decide first whether she can forgive him and then whether she trusts him enough to untangle her from Sebastians web of manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forever Yours is the compelling tale of one womans journey as the past intertwines with the present and helps her in her quest to find love and her true destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />

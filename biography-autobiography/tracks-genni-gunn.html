  <title>Tracks - Genni Gunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tracks&lt;/i&gt; is a compilation of personal travel essays that range across three continents: from Italy, where Genni Gunn was born and spent her early years, to Canada and Mexico, and through Asia, where she has travelled many times, both reconnecting with her sister and witnessing the emergence of new political realities in Myanmar. While these are journeys into the new and unknown, they also trigger the inner journey to the realm of memory. These pieces dig deep into personal territory, exploring the bonds of an unusually peripatetic family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, Gunn&#39;s parents travelled within Italy, settling wherever Gunn&#39;s father&#39;s work took him. Their two young daughters were sent to live with relatives, Genni in southern Italy, her sister Ileana in northern Italy. The family was eventually reunited in Canada. Gunn&#39;s father was a mysterious presence -- much later she learned he was working with British Intelligence, but during her childhood all she knew was that he would disappear as suddenly as he had appeared. Indelibly marked by their unusual childhood, the sisters became wanderers themselves. While in some ways, their world shrank with the departure of their parents, in other ways, their imaginations were opened to new possibilities. Gunn explores some of those possibilities in this collection.  An inveterate traveller, she questions the impulse behind the need to stay in motion, to always be the &quot;other&quot; in the world, while always seeking the home that never was.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Response-Able to the Incomprehensible - Edgar K. DeJean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For more than seventy years, author Edgar K. DeJean practiced a conditioned belief system in the form of Orthodox Presbyterianism. Now, in the twenty-first century, he explains how his searching and exploring of spirituality and religion has led him to a more candid belief system that is casual, flexible, and logicalas opposed to one that is conditioned, cultural, rigid, and traditional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Response-Able to the Incomprehensible, he delves into his mission, which centers on the possibilities within being response-able to the incomprehensible metaphysical energy through spirituality and compassion. Through a series of short essays originally created as blog posts, he describes this belief system he deems more appropriate and responsive to todays times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While studying the core beliefs and traditions of Christianity, DeJean focuses on explaining and defining the statement of purpose: be spiritualdo compassion. Response-Able to the Incomprehensible discusses the search for spirituality in everyday life and appraises and tests existing traditions and compassion in that same sphere.&lt;/p&gt;" />

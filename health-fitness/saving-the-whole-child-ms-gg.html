  <title>Saving the Whole Child - Ms. Gg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The traditional role for grandparents is to have their grandchildren visit them and to enjoy being spoiled by them before returning to their parents. But in the last few years, many grandparents have found themselves in the parenting role. In &lt;i&gt;Saving the Whole Child&lt;/i&gt;, author Ms. GG shares her personal experiences when she became the custodial grandparent of her two identical twin grandsons and the journey that took them from special education to the juvenile justice system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Saving the Whole Child&lt;/i&gt; covers a multitude of transformative experiences that families and caregivers face daily. As an advocate for childrens rights, Ms. GG discusses the difficulty in securing counseling services and overcoming racial and economic disparity to acquire the needed services. She focuses on letting the voices of those in need be heard while never giving up, never being quiet about concerns, and most importantly, always reminding children their disabilities do not define them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a thorough additional reading list included, &lt;i&gt;Saving the Whole Child&lt;/i&gt; helps parents, caregivers, therapists, and doctors understand the issues children with special needs and their families face daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are also given encouragement and inspiration to share their story with others. Our voices can no longer remain silent.&lt;/p&gt;" />

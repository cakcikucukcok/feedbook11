  <title>The Art of Being a Brilliant Classroom Assistant - Gary Toward, Chris Henley, Andy Cope, Amy Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on the authors&#39; combined 70 plus years of experience, The Art of Being a Brilliant Classroom Assistant by Andy Cope, Chris Henley and Gary Toward is packed full of creative tips, techniques and strategies for anyone with the crucial role of supporting kids&#39; learning. There are many different names and acronyms for these amazing classroom practitioners: teaching assistants (TAs), learning support assistants (LSAs), cover supervisors, supply teachers, student mentors, higher level teaching assistants (HLTAs), learning partners - the list goes on. The title doesn’t matter but the quality of support, interaction and learning does. Whether you work one-to-one with individual children, support small groups or work with a whole class - and whether you work in a primary, secondary or special setting - this book is packed with ideas to enhance your practice so you can best support children’s learning, while looking out for your own well-being and enjoying your role. You can dip in for top tips, anecdotes, practical strategies and advice on every aspect of the role, as well as have a chuckle as you go. For example, did you know there is a patron saint for just about everything? There is even a patron saint of failures, Birgitta of Sweden, who presumably failed to impress Ofsted on more than one occasion. If you scour the list you&#39;ll find that every occupation has a nominated guardian looking after their well-being. That is, except one - classroom assistants. So, if there&#39;s nobody &#39;up there&#39; cheering you on, you might need to find the resources within yourself - and Andy, Chris and Gary can help. Because, let&#39;s face it, working with youngsters isn&#39;t for the fainthearted is it? What do you do if you are sworn at? How do you engage a reluctant learner? What about safeguarding? How do you support children with SEND? How do you handle a challenging parent? How can you develop your career further? These topics, and a whole raft more, are woven into this book which will set you on the road to brilliance! It doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s inspiration or new ideas you want - this book has a plethora of both. It may challenge your thinking, it may persuade you to do something different, and above all it will put you in serious danger of being brilliant at what you do. There&#39;s nothing more important or vital than the education and development of our youngsters: the mission of the Art of Being Brilliant series is to help all educators unlock their brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;" />

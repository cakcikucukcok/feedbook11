  <title>Husband By Contract (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Helen Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;The jealous husband! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Donato Vittoria, marriage was a lifetime commitment. He&#39;d chosed Grace as his bride, and he would cherish her forever. Or so Grace had believed… . Until she&#39;d discovered Donato&#39;s betrayal - with Maria, a beautiful family friend.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Had he forgotten his vows so soon? Did he expect Grace to play the dutiful wife, while he continued to enjoy a bachelor life-style? The hurt had been unbearable, and Grace had fled. But Donato insisted he was still her husband - by contract - and he wanted Grace back in his life, and his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HUSBANDS &amp; WIVES &lt;em&gt;Sometimes the perfect marraige is worth waiting for!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

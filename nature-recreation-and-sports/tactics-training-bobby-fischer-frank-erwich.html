  <title>Tactics Training - Bobby Fischer - Frank Erwich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bobby Fischer
Robert James &#39;Bobby&#39; Fischer (1943-2008) was the eleventh World Chess Champion. In 1972 the American defeated the reigning World Champion at that time, Boris Spassky, in a very tense match. People still talk about this &#39;Cold War confrontation&#39;, which was known for its dramatic events.
Fischer&#39;s road to the World title did not go unnoticed by Hollywood. On September 2015 the movie &#39;Pawn Sacrifice&#39; was released in the United States. The movie is based on Bobby&#39;s Fischer&#39;s challenging of the top Soviet chess grandmasters during the Cold War, resulting in the clash with Spassky in 1972.
In 1975, Fischer abdicated his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the World Chess Federation. After that he disappeared from the chess scene, but suddenly emerged to play a re-match against Boris Spassky in 1992. He won the match convincingly, although experts claimed he no longer had the strength of a World Champion.
Again, after beating Spassky in a match, Fischer did not play (tournament) chess anymore. Fischer only hit the headlines for his controversial views and behavior outside the chessboard. During his career he was known for &#39;being different&#39;, but as time progressed his behavior became more and more strange.
After 1992, for twelve years Fischer was on the run from the US government, which issued an arrest warrant against him for violating the UN sanctions and not paying his taxes. Eventually, Iceland granted him asylum in 2005. At the symbolic age of 64 Fischer died in a hospital in Reykjavik, the city where he had become World Champion.
Bobby Fischer was one the greatest chess players of all time. He was renowned for his opening preparation, but probably most people will remember Fischer as the attacking player with a relentless will to win. Some typical Fischer quotes: &quot;Chess is war over the board. The object is to crush the opponent&#39;s mind. I like the moment when I break a man&#39;s ego. You have to have the fighting spirit. You have to force moves and take chances.&quot;
Another thing Fischer said was, &quot;All that matters on the chessboard is good moves!&quot; In this tactics training book you will get the opportunity to play the same good moves as Fischer did. This book offers you one hundred training exercises, in which Fischer turned the game in his favour. The puzzles start at a moderate level and gradually get more difficult. Good luck!" />

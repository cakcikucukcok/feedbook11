  <title>Pooling Talent: Swimming&#39;s Greatest Teams - Matthew De George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Pooling Talent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;highlights relay teams, squads, and programs spanning nearly a century of competitive swimming. From the 1976 U.S. Women&amp;rsquo;s 400 Freestyle relay to the 2001 Australian squad, and even including the North Baltimore Aquatic Club that has trained some of swimming&amp;rsquo;s top athletes, Matthew De George details these amazing assemblages of talent. De George delves into the intricate interplay between team and individual success, how four opponents can mesh quickly into a team and meet the challenges of performing as one. Certain accomplishments, even by some of the most illustrious names in the lexicon of swimming greats, can only be explained through the lens of the teams supporting them&amp;mdash;Michael Phelps would never have earned a record eight gold medals in the 2008 Olympics were it not for his teammates&amp;rsquo; world-record setting efforts in the 400 freestyle. Each chapter in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Pooling Talent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;examines a separate relay team, national squad, or program, profiling the top swimmers, detailing their best moments, and examining what made that team so successful. Extensively researched, this book takes a novel look at swimming accomplishments old and new, casting the accolades of individuals in a fresh light. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

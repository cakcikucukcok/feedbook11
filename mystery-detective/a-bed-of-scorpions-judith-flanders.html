  <title>A Bed of Scorpions - Judith Flanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Summer  in London-the sun is finally shining, the flowers are in bloom, and  life is humming merrily along for book editor Samantha Clair, off to  lunch with her old friend, art-dealer Aidan Merriam.  Humming merrily  until she learns that his partner has just been found dead in their  gallery, slumped over his desk with a gun in his hand.  Could anything  be worse? Oh yes, the police investigation is being led by Inspector  Jake Field, who just happens to be Sam&#39;s new boyfriend.  And Aidan, who  just happens to be Sam&#39;s ex-boyfriend, wants Sam&#39;s help. Finding herself  drawn into another investigation, Sam does the only sensible thing and  calls her mother.  Before long, Sam finds her loyalties stretched to the  limit as she herself is threatened.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with nothing more  than her trusty weapons of satire, cynicism and a stock of irrelevant  information culled from novels, Sam races to find a killer who is  determined to find her first in the newest fast-paced, uproarious novel  in the critically acclaimed series from New York Times bestselling  author Judith Flanders.&lt;/p&gt;" />

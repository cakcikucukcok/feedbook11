  <title>Doves (Love in Los Angeles, #2) - Racheline Maltese, Erin McRae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="J. Alex Cook never wanted to be famous, he just wanted to get out of Indiana. Now two years after the events of Starling, Hollywood&amp;#39;s brightest star is living happily ever after with his boyfriend, television writer Paul Marion Keane. But when Paul&amp;rsquo;s pilot, Winsome, AZ, gets picked up, the competing demands of their high-profile careers make them question their future together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Paul becomes increasingly absent from their relationship, Alex tries to regain control of his private life and establish a career path independent of Fourth&amp;#39;s enigmatic, and at times malevolent, showrunner Victor. But the delicate web of relationships that connects Alex, Paul, and their friends &amp;mdash; including Alex&amp;#39;s excitable ex-lover Liam and his no-nonsense fianc&amp;eacute;e Carly &amp;mdash; threatens to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the business of Hollywood making it hard to remember who he is when the whole world isn&amp;rsquo;t watching, Alex is forced to confront major changes in the fairy tale life he never wanted as he discovers that love in Los Angeles often looks nothing like the movies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be aware, this is a high-heat, high-angst romance and includes characters with a past history of self-harm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This title was previously published by Torquere Press. This is a newly updated and revised edition. Doves is book two in the Love in Los Angeles series." />

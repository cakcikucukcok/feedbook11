  <title>A Legacy of Ivy, Roses and Pearls - Phi Eta Omega Chapter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the chronological history of one of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sororitys graduate chapters, Phi Eta Omega of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, from its chartering in 1999 through 2013. 
Ten inactive members (sorors) of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., rekindling a desire to be of service to others, assembled at a sorors home in Plainfield, New Jersey, in the early winter of 1998. Soon this small group grew to fourteen and, ultimately, to seventeen women. These seventeen inactive sorors became an official interest group of the sorority later that year. With the mission to promote harmony and friendship among members, to develop and implement programs to enhance the self-esteem of youth, and to assist others wherever needed in their communities, these women, full of energy and enthusiasm, ventured into unknown waters. 
Becoming the first Greek letter organization to affiliate with the New Jersey Orators, the Scotch Plains/Union County Interest Group helped foster the development of confidence and public speaking skills in youth ages seven to seventeen. TAG, a weekly tutorial program, was also established. 
Since its chartering on June 6, 1999, Phi Eta Omega Chapter continues to institute and participate in other altruistic programs: the Angel Network; collection of coats and other winter clothing during local coat drives; donation of suits for Dress Barns Dress for Success; financial support to two Kenyan students in Africa; donation of duffel bags filled with pajamas, clothing, books, and other sundries to Union County Division of Child Protection and Permanency; and the replacement of the headstone of Caesar, a Revolutionary Warfreed slave, at Scotch Plains Baptist Church in Scotch Plains, New Jersey." />

  <title>Learning and the Affective Approach - Acene Fleurmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book, Learning and the Affective Approach, is a demonstration of the importance of affection, love, association, and integration for kids, preschoolers, and schoolers in their immediate environment and learning journey. That was an intellectual work that led us to a profound reflection on learning and on human intelligence (which we redefined in chapter 1), which facilitates the learning processhow we acquire knowledge, what makes people appear more intelligent or less, and what hinders the process of acquiescing knowledge. Lastly, we have come to understand why Benjamin Bloom had so much success with the publication of his Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Cognitive Domain in 1956. In addition, we understood why David Krathwohl had to build upon Blooms ideas to publish a new book on educational taxonomy related to affection. The former infuses cognitive notions into the kids mind, and the latter relaxes it to facilitate the reception (chapter 2)." />

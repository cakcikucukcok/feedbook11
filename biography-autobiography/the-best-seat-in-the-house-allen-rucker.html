  <title>The Best Seat in the House - Allen Rucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like the day Elvis died or O.J. was acquitted, the Tuesday you wake up paralyzed is not a day you soon forget. For writer Allen Rucker&amp;#8212;baby boomer, husband, father of two, aging Hollywood also-ran&amp;#8212;life started over that Tuesday when, at the age of fifty-one, he was struck by a rare disorder&amp;#8212;transverse myelitis&amp;#8212;that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Why him? Was he being punished? Was it his stressful life? His frustrating career? Telling too many Christopher Reeve jokes? Dazed and paralyzed, he was forced to reevaluate everything, from the simplest bodily functions to the mysteries of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a style that is at once funny and moving, &lt;em&gt;The Best Seat in the House&lt;/em&gt; offers an unpretentious and unapologetic account of learning to live with paralysis. Without trivializing his situation, and without sermons or clich&amp;#233;s, Rucker invites all readers, whether disabled or not, to identify with him for better or for worse. This remarkably comic and heartfelt book speaks to the fragility of life and to the resilience and adaptability of a single, ordinary human being. Lucky for us, this human being has a sense of humor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, it may not look like the best seat in the house, but read on. You might be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;" />

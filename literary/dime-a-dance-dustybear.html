  <title>Dime a Dance - Dustybear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is where it all startedthe adventures of Dustybear and that rag-taggle bunch of sillies nicknamed The Redneck Mafia.  There he was, quietly minding his own business, when suddenly into his homeand his lifecame Frankie and Tess. Little did he know at that point that by merely listening to their story (and maybe getting a book out of it) that he would find himself drawn smack dab into the middle of one of the most bizarreand dangerousadventures he could have ever imagined
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ahhh, but he was.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Little did he know that he would find himself in so much danger...along with Frankie, Tess, and
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ahhh, but pretty quick, he was.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Little did he know that this large and very disparate group of people would become such an integral part of his futureand his life. That they would become as much a part of him almost as life itselfand that he, his safety and security, and his very life would become totally dependent on them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ahhh, but
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just exactly how did our hapless author, our trusty Dustybear, get so caught up in all that mystery and intrigue. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Caught upIN MURDER? GASP!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For that matter, how does sweet and innocent Tess come to be so caught up in organized crime, while dragging Frankie along with her? Then Bear? Then
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ahhh, but Tess is where it all starts. But how?  Why?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Youll just have to read Dime A Dance to find out. Meanie, arent I.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dime A Dance. Book I, Part I  The Dance is where it all starts, telling the story of Tess beginnings. Tess and Frankies beginnings. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How they meet, and how they find themselves ultimately on the run from the Mafiaafter they fall in love, of course. It also introduces the rest of the group, including Dustybear. It sets the stage for all that is to follow, and a wild ride it is. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dime A Dance. Book I, Part II  The Plan sees Frankie, Tess, Bear, and 
The Redneck Mafia going undercover and infiltrating one of the most powerful organized crime families in the country headed by Antonio Catalafanowith no one in that family the wiser as to their true identitiesor so they think.  Then what happens? 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ahhh, therein lies the mystery. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With more twists and turns than a San Francisco street and more thrills than a roller coaster at full throttle, Dime A Dance will keep you on the edge of your seat, and keep you rooting for the good guys
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
IF
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 you can figure out just exactly who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The lines get blurred, and frequently even Dustybear isnt too sureand maybe life just isnt always all that simple. Good vs evil. Black and white.
Nope. It definitely isnt.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not for Frankie and Tess. Not certainly for Dustybear. Not for Rose and Billy. For Ofelia. Toneboi, Ryan, Derek, Eric, Brenda, Elkeand the rest.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its a real pandoras box.  Bear opens that night when he opens the front door of his home in southern Louisiana. He opens it to Frankie, Tess, and
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ahhh. But, therein lies the storydoesnt it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, why dont you come along with Bear as he spins a tale of mystery, intrigue, sex and violence, and of courselove. I think you will find that you will get as caught up in the story, and the characters, and all the restas I did, when I wrote

  <title>Married Under the Influence - Harmony Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the wife of an alcoholic, author Harmony Rose searched for some validity to her emotions: she didnt want to feel crazy anymore or continue to carry the shame and blame that came with her husbands alcoholism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Married under the Influence, she shares her story of living year after year with a husband who is an alcoholic. With excerpts from her journal entries, Rose tells how all she ever wanted was to be loved by the man she had given her heart to, but she had no idea how to reach him, even briefly contemplating suicide. Then, she had a spiritual awakening that changed their lives forever. She tells the details of her journey to not only help her understand and heal, but to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including interviews with recovering alcoholics and with other wives whose husbands are alcoholics, Married under the Influence offers stories of strength, love, and hope. It shows how forgiveness can free you from your own emotional prison and how loving unconditionally doesnt have to mean losing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Advisory Leadership - Greg Friedman, Deena B. Katz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Thrive in a changing industry by putting your people first&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Advisory Leadership&lt;/i&gt; is a practical and highly executable guide for financial advisors and finance professionals looking to thrive in today&#39;s changing financial services industry. Written by a leading financial advisor with practice improvement expertise, this book shows you how to master the art of leadership while remaining agile and adaptable. You&#39;ll learn the seven steps you must take to keep pace and thrive amidst the industry&#39;s evolution, with clearly articulated explanations and motivational action items. The discussion covers patience, integrity, compassion, respect, consistency, encouragement, and courage—the foundations of success and continued growth—and shows you how to practice what you preach with real strategies for living the vision and being a true leader. &lt;p&gt;The financial services industry is at a crossroads, between a generation on the cusp of retirement and the new generation stepping in to take its place. This transition has been called a crisis of culture, of values, and of communication, but it&#39;s really an &lt;i&gt;opportunity&lt;/i&gt;. This book faces the changes head-on, and delivers practical solutions that start and end with your greatest resource—your people. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Unlock the secrets to a people-first company&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Speak openly, walk the walk, and promote personal growth&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reward firm-wide collaboration and a team mentality&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reshape your company&#39;s DNA to thrive in today&#39;s financial environment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The industry&#39;s overarching question is one of differentiation: how can your firm stand out amid the rise of robo-solutions and an unpredictable future? &lt;i&gt;Advisory Leadership&lt;/i&gt; shows you how a people-focused company culture can elevate a firm from surviving to thriving." />

  <title>Light Will Emerge - Kaci King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kaci King learned early on in life that everything has a purpose, even though the purpose may not be easily seen. After developing a lasting friendship with a disabled neighbor during her childhood, Kaci never realized that his attitude about lifes toughest challenges would inspire her years later as she faced the most difficult years of her life.
Three years after Kaci and her husband, Rea, married, their beautiful daughter was born. Although Madi incessantly cried, everyone assumed she was just a strong-willed child. Twenty months later, a baby boy joined their family. Everything seemed normal, until Austin began showing little interest in eating. As Kaci details the frustrating path that finally led her to receive a shocking diagnosis for both childrencraniosynostosis and chiari malformationshe shares a poignant story through journal entries and personal narratives that reveal how she became an advocate for her children, learned to navigate through a complex medical system, and launched a determined search for help that eventually led her to an angel in disguise: Dr. Ben Carson.
Light Will Emerge shares one mothers journey to find help for her children during a medical crisis that will inspire parents and caregivers to persevere through their own struggles and realize that hope can exist, even during the darkest of days. In all, the book journeys the reader through two dozen surgeries sharing tribulations to triumph as the children beat all odds, accomplishing more than anyone ever expected including four World Champion titles." />

  <title>The Essential Hoof Book - Christina Cline, Susan Kauffmann, Gene Ovnicek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The equine hoof is a complex marvel of natural engineering, built to withstand tremendous forces and able to adapt to an astonishing range of environmental conditions. It also changes daily&amp;#150for better or for worse&amp;#150in response to external and internal factors. Few horse owners have the opportunity to acquire a deep understanding of the hoof, which limits their ability to advocate on their horses&amp;rsquo; behalf and make informed decisions about hoof care and management. This book is the first resource of its kind to combine the most current and useful information available, gleaned from the research and wisdom of top hoof experts around the world, with a unique &amp;ldquo;hands-on&amp;rdquo; approach. The authors provide basic terms and anatomy, clearly illustrate the differences between healthy and unhealthy feet, discuss biomechanics and management concerns, and cover the causes, treatments, and prevention of commonly encountered problems, including laminitis, white line disease, and thrush. Along the way, readers are given activities to help them better analyze and understand the most important aspects of equine hoof health, such as hoof balance, depth of sole, and point of breakover.  Easy&amp;#150to&amp;#150follow language, over 400 full&amp;#150color photographs, and do&amp;#150it&amp;#150yourself exercises promise to empower horse owners and caretakers of all experience levels with the tools they need to accurately assess hoof health and keep their horses as sound and happy as possible.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  <title>The Right to Privacy in India - Gaurav Goyal, Ravinder Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two legal scholars of India examine privacy in India, how it is different from privacy in the West, and why it needs to be protected in this carefully researched book.
Gaurav Goyal and Ravinder Kumar argue that privacy laws in India are weak because politicians have failed to pass laws to protect it. Even in the West, its not always clear whats protected in terms of privacy.
They further argue that ones private sphere is subjective and depends on ones culture, environment, and economic condition. For instance, the media constantly infringe on the right to privacy of famous and even not-so-famous individuals.
In examining privacy in India, the authors highlight:
	why certain classes of people enjoy more privacy than others;
	how technology is changing the way we approach privacy; and
	why people feel compelled to snoop into the personal space of others.
While privacy may seem like a simple concept, its important to understand its historical context, the laws that govern it, and how it continues to change if you want to have any chance of protecting it in India." />

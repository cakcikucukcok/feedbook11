  <title>Hitting with Torque - Paul F. Petricca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul Petricca draws on his experience as a coach, player, blogger, and student of baseball and softball to share what hes learned about hitting in this essential guide for players seeking dramatic results at the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author presents easy to understand hitting mechanics highlighting how the engineering concept of torque can be applied to hitting and is often the difference between a weak groundball or a long home run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include understanding where hitting power really comes from and the importance of increasing bat speed through the fundamentals of a repeatable and powerful rotational swing. Hitters of all ages who adopt his eight hitting keys will enjoy a dramatic increase in bat speed and power almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting with Torque is more than a set of hitting mechanics---its a mindset. Readers will be challenged to look past the worn-out hitting theories and myths that have been holding back hitters from reaching their full potential. With an open mind and practice, all hitters can unlock the power and consistency that is Hitting with Torque.&lt;/p&gt;" />

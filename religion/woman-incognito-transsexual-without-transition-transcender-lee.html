  <title>Woman Incognito: Transsexual Without Transition - Transcender Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woman Incognito&lt;/em&gt; presents the story of a woman in a male body who has chosen not to undergo transition through hormones or surgery. As a &amp;ldquo;non-transition transsexual,&amp;rdquo; Lee&amp;rsquo;s journey towards acceptance of her true gender has been decades&amp;nbsp;long, difficult, and remarkable. A two-year stint in a mental hospital in the 1960s left her confused and ashamed. But gradually, with the help of two enlightened therapists and a supportive spouse, she discovered the source of her lifelong confusion and despair, and was at last able to embrace her true identity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Calling herself Transcender Lee, she hopes by sharing her intimate story&amp;nbsp;that others who are struggling with gender identity will recognize all of the options available to them, and feel less isolated in their journeys. She also hopes, by honest sharing, to help all her readers expand their understanding of the fascinating world of gender diversity. Transcender Lee has had a lifelong interest in both religion and politics and has been active in both areas. While involved in the Libertarian Party, she combined the two pursuits by founding a Christian libertarian fellowship and publishing two related newsletters. More recently, she has been part of a movement to make Christian churches more accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. She has been&amp;nbsp;active in the United Methodist Church and has held&amp;nbsp;leadership positions at the local and annual conference levels in that denomination.&lt;/p&gt;" />

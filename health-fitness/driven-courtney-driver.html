  <title>Driven - Courtney Driver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if I told you that the keys &amp; vehicle for you to achieve your own personal and financial success, are already within you... hiding in plain sight. That if you were looking for signs from God or Buddha or a Higher Power, that you could look no further than the dashboard of your own car. What ? Yes, that&#39;s right, what if every-time something went wrong in your life and you were looking to fix it, all you had to do was honestly look at the state of affairs of your current car and that it was a mirror representation of how you&#39;re actually doing in this world &amp; what you need to actually work on to improve. Likewise, if you have no car at the moment to test this out, this is your biggest sign of all, you have NO VEHICLE for where you&#39;re trying to go, so if life were a race or a journey or a road trip to arrive at, you Sir or Madame aren&#39;t even at the starting line, you&#39;re up in the bleachers watching everything from a distance and you need to up your game. But, for the sake of the book and the analogies within it, fast forward to the point when you will have a car and or flashback to the past when you did and follow along. For example, what gave me the idea for this book was a day not to long ago about 1year and 1/2 ago. I was a newly single mom with my son Jax in the back of our car and he was crying his eyes out for me to make things better ( our electricity had just been cut off ) and in that moment I was crying my eyes out too, because I didn&#39;t know how I was going to make it through. I read all the pregnancy books and painted all the walls of his nursery and prepared all of his pureed meals 2 months in advance but the one thing I didn&#39;t prepare for was having to overnight become the breadwinner and the daddy and the security guard at night in our family and the handyman during the day, while doing and taking care of all my other responsabilites as a mom.." />

  <title>HACON THE KING - A True Story of a Viking King - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 296&lt;br /&gt;
In this 296th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Norse/Viking story of &amp;ldquo;HACON THE KING.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Hacon is but a babe when is father dies in battle and the Kingdom of Norway splits into two camps. One supports the babes right to the throne and the other wants to claim the throne for their Pretender.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Realising the problem, Babe Hacon and his mother are spirited North and hidden by loyal followers whilst the armies of the Pretender scour the country for him, but the snowdrifts through which Queen Inga and Hacon had won their way proved too deep for them, and they went back to Erling Stone-wall, whom they had chosen king. Starving from lack of food, they are rescued and led to safety.&lt;br /&gt;
Hacon, protected by Thorir the archbishop grew up in relative peace and was educated in the ways of kingship in preparation for the day in which he would be ready to assume his rightful role.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These then are the adventures of young King Hacon from the time he was a babe to the time he assumed the crown of Norway and for the long time thereafter when he led Norway through one of the most peaceful and prosperous times in it&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;br /&gt;
You are invited to download and read the story telling of how he did this throughout his long and fruitful life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

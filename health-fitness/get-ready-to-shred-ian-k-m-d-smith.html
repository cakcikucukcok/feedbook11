  <title>Get Ready to Shred - Ian K. M.D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ian K. Smith&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Get Ready to Shred&lt;/i&gt; is the key to jumpstarting significant and permanent weight loss. If you&#39;ve asked yourself: how to lose that last twenty pounds? How to push through that frustrating plateau? What to do when nothing else is working? Then, you need to know about &lt;i&gt;SHRED &lt;/i&gt;- Dr. Ian K Smith&#39;s revolutionary diet.  And &lt;i&gt;Get Ready to Shred &lt;/i&gt;is your chance to try out the first 2 weeks (recipes, excercises, tips &amp; tricks &amp; more) of the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the SHRED diet (available in full in &lt;i&gt;SHRED - &lt;/i&gt;coming from Dr. Ian K. Smith &amp; St. Martin&#39;s Press in December 2013), Smith, author of &lt;i&gt;The Fat Smash Diet&lt;/i&gt;, has created a program that uses all he knows about strategic dieting in one plan--like putting all the best players on the field at once to create a can&#39;t lose combination. SHRED combines a low GI diet, meal spacing, and meal replacements. Those who follow SHRED  will be eating often (every three and a half hours!)--four meals or meal replacements (soups, smoothies, shakes) and 3 snacks a day. SHRED also introduces Dr. Ian&#39;s concept of &quot;Diet Confusion&quot;. Diet Confusion, like muscle confusion, tricks the body and revs up its performance. In the same way you need to vary your workout to see results, you&#39;ll switch up your food intake to boost your metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how often or how unsuccessfully you&#39;ve dieted before, SHRED will change your life.  So, dip into &lt;i&gt;Get Ready to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Shred&lt;/i&gt; (or the full diet in &lt;i&gt;SHRED&lt;/i&gt;) and get started on the diet has taken the internet by storm - inspiring thousands to join Dr. Ian&#39;s Shredder Nation, losing five or more pounds in the first week! Take the first steps to a new way of life!&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The sustained comedy in this hilarious novel is equaled only by its heart, and the myriad ways there are for it to break. I love this book.

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Up Jumps the Devil - Michael Poore</i></b> | Overflowing with imagination, insight, and humor, rippling with history and myth, Up Jumps the Devil is as madcap and charming as the Devil himself. About the Author Michael Poore’s work has appeared in the Southern Review, the Carolina Quarterly, Hayden’s Ferry Review, Fiction, StoryQuarterly, and Glimmer Train and has been nominated for a 2011 Pushcart Prize.<br /><b><i>Up Jumps the Devil: Poore, Michael: 9780062064417: Amazon ...</i></b> | Michael Poore is a skillful writer, and his new novel, "Up Jumps the Devil," is a good book. There's not much of a plot to this droll narrative that's mainly about John Scratch (a/k/a the Devil) and a musical trio with whom he forges a Faustian bargain just before the 1969 Woodstock music festival.<br /><b><i>Up Jumps the Devil by Michael Poore - Goodreads</i></b> | “Part fable, part warped historical travelogue, Up Jumps the Devil is an inscrutably charming debut novel that poses the question: What if Satan wasn’t that bad a guy? I don’t know where Michael Poore came from, but I sure am glad he’s here.”<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Up Jumps the Devil - Michael Poore</a> </h3></p><hr/>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Marry Me under the Mistletoe&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After single dad Rick Jenner and his little daughter stumble upon Andrea Fleming&#39;s toy shop one snowy evening, he can&#39;t get Andrea&#39;s beautiful eyes out of his head. But with Christmas coming up, he can&#39;t afford any distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Andrea is no stranger to heartache, and Rick has it written all over his face. Her head tells her to stay away, but nevertheless she is irresistibly drawn to this twosome in need of a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a few festive sparks, a little girl&#39;s yuletide delight and a toe-curling kiss under the mistletoe…this Christmas, anything could happen!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Little Bit of Holiday Magic&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All widow Grace Wilcox wants is a fresh start for her and her young son, Liam. When her truck spins off the icy road, her rescuer turns out to be the hottest fire fighter in Hood Hamlet, and even wary Grace can’?t say no to his offer of help!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bill Paulson has stuck to his no-dating rule so far this Christmas, but having Grace in his home is testing his chivalrous side to the limit! Her little boy is melting his heart, even asking for a new daddy from Santa….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Grace has already loved and lost one hero. Can she really let herself get close to another?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Christmas Magic in Heatherdale&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cosy market town of Heatherdale is a refuge for paediatrician Mia Redmond. Alone and penniless, her only hope is a once elegant Victorian house to restore and sell…much to the interest of her new neighbour—and new boss—consultant paediatrician Ryan Ferguson!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single dad Ryan is unsettled by his attraction to the vulnerable Mia—his young daughters and his work are all he has time for. But as the falling snow and fairy lights turn Heatherdale into a place of magic and wonder, Ryan realises that all he wants for Christmas is Mia—in his arms!&lt;/p&gt;

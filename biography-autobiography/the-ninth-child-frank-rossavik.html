  <title>The Ninth Child - Frank Rossavik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Jewish boy is sent to Norway in 1939. He survives; his parents and sister succumb in the gas chamber in Auschwitz.
The boy&#39;s Norwegian foster father joined the Nazi party and became a staunch supporter of Adolf Hitler and Vidkun Quisling.
Having been turned down when trying to enlist as a soldier to fight alongside the German army against Russian troops, Arne Norman continued to fill his wartime position of Mayor of Laksevag. Edgar stayed with Arne and Agnes till the end of 1942. No one in the household knew that 1942 was the year of the deaths of Edgar&#39;s parents and sister. Years later, when Arne was released after serving time in prison for treason, Edgar returned to stay with Arne, Agnes, and their adopted daughter." />

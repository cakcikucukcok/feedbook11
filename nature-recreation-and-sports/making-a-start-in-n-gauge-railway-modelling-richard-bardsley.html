  <title>Making a Start in N Gauge Railway Modelling - Richard Bardsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="N gauge is the most rapidly expanding of all the model railway formats and if you want to take advantage of its huge potential, then this is the book for you. The author explains exactly what N gauge is, its history, its advantages and some of its possible disadvantages. He begins with a train set and progresses through choosing a prototype and designing a layout, to a practical demonstration of how to build a baseboard, to designs for open-topped baseboards and fiddle yards. Tells you all you need to know about the different track products that are available and the differences between sectional and flexible track. Provides detailed, yet easily understandable, descriptions of how to lay track, cut it to size, join it, and connect it between baseboards. Explains the terminology of turnouts and the different ways to operate them. Explores the differences between DC and DCC control, and how to get power to the track. Considers wiring for turnouts and isolation sections. Discusses all the types of ballasting and presents comprehensive advice on how to apply and fix loose ballast. Examines ready-to-run rolling stock available in N gauge as well as kit building and conversion of locomotives to DCC. Provides guidance on couplers, from the traditional types to the latest designs such as knuckle couplers and close coupling mechanisms. Covers modelling the railway infrastructure, such as platforms and signal boxes, how to make realistic rural and urban scenery, and how to bring your layout to life by adding details such as people, road vehicles and signs. Lavishly illustrated with 285 colour photographs and 20 diagrams." />

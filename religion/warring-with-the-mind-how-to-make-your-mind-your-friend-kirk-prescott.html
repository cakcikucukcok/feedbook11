  <title>Warring with the Mind … How to Make Your Mind Your Friend - Kirk Prescott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most Christians think their minds will automatically cooperate with them in their walk as Christians. However, this isnt true. The mind must be brought under subjection to the spirit of the living God for this to happen. The book you are holding will help you with this process. It lays out practical applications for using the Bible for the purpose of renewing the mind and making it your friend. We must, with our minds, love God and purpose to serve Him. We must also come to the place where we understand we have been self-serving. Only the teaching of the Bible will bring this to fruition in the mind of the believer. That is what MAKE YOUR MIND YOUR FRIEND is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author used the principles laid out in this book with life-changing results both in ministry and his personal life. As you apply what is taught in this book to your life, you may begin to experience new levels of freedom in your mind. Some of the principles set forth you may or may not know, however it is all supported by Scriptures. As you take this journey, keep a God-centered mindset, and you will be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;" />

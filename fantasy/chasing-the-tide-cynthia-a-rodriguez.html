      <meta name="description" content="Faced with the inability to move forward, Liza, daughter of the king of merpeople, fights her inner demons in order to go to Nivineon and meet her people as their ruler. But, the need for vengeance living inside of her is all-consuming. Relationships, both old and new, become strained, and Liza realizes she must come to terms with her life and take charge as the queen of demi. Being in charge is hard enough without having the entire demi race against you. During her time in training, Liza becomes stronger than she ever thought she could be. When another tragedy hits closer to home, she finds her way back to Mystic as a new woman. Life was easier when Liza knew her enemies and the reason behind her vendetta against the Sea Witch. But, everything she thought she knew is about to change. The second installment in the Mystic Series, Chasing the Tide, is a fast-paced novel that will break your heart, mend it, and give you hope renewed." />

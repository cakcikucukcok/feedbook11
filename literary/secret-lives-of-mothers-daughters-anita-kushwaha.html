  <title>Secret Lives of Mothers &amp; Daughters - Anita Kushwaha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A breathtaking novel about the ties that bind mothers and daughters together and the secrets that tear them apart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veena, Mala and Nandini are three very different women with something in common. Out of love, each bears a secret that will haunt her life&amp;#8212;and that of her daughter&amp;#8212;because the risk of telling the truth is too great. But secrets have consequences. Particularly for Asha, a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, who links them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her eighteenth birthday, Asha is devastated to learn that she was adopted as a baby. What&amp;#8217;s more, her birth mother died of a mysterious illness, leaving Asha with only a letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nandini, Asha&amp;#8217;s adoptive mother, has always feared the truth would come between them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veena, a recent widow, worries about her daughter Mala&amp;#8217;s future. The shock of her husband&amp;#8217;s sudden death leaves her shaken and convinces her that the only way to keep her daughter safe is to secure her future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mala struggles to balance her dreams and ambition with her mother&amp;#8217;s expectations. She must bear a secret, the burden of which threatens her very life.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;Three mothers&amp;#8212;each bound by love, deceit and a young woman who connects them all. &lt;em&gt;Secret Lives of Mothers &amp;#38; Daughters&lt;/em&gt; is an intergenerational novel about family, duty and the choices we make in the name of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />

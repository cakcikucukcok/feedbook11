  <title>Crickets Are Chirping but No One Can Hear Them - Inge Logenburg Kyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Crickets Are Chirping But No One Can Hear Them is a book meant to be helpful to persons dealing with family members diagnosed with dementia. Uplifting and humorous in places, it encourages caregivers to remain optimistic and cheerful despite what seems to be insurmountable obstacles. No one looks forward to such a diagnosis, and yet it affects a great many people in todays world. It strikes at the most inopportune time and can affect people at any age and stage of life. But like many things, it does not have to be totally devastating. It can be a time of garnering and developing patience and understanding where those things might not have been. It also reveals shortcomings in todays medical field in that there is a need for more information, treatment, and financial aid to cope with this ailment that affects so many lives. This is the story of one family, how dementia affected them, and how they dealt with it. Each and every family deals with a situation differently as each situation is different, but all in all, we learn from one another." />

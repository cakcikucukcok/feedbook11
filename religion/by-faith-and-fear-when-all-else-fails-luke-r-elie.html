  <title>By Faith and Fear: When All Else Fails - Luke R. Elie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is it that makes you move through life from opportunity to opportunity? Is it faith that inspires you to do things out of the ordinary, or is it fear? Fear is a scary force indeed. If youre standing on a railroad track with a speeding train closing in, what is your reaction? Is it fear that you might die that forces you to move? Is it faith that the train is on a destructive path that causes you to move? Or is it just simple instinct born out of self-preservation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a philosophical book, and I do not want to waste time sorting out the differences. The most important thing I have found in life is that faith makes me do things I thought I could never do, and fear does likewise. In this book, well sort out many individuals in the Old Testament who were moved by both forces and yet were still called righteous. They were all on an incredible journey. But where were they going? What were they really seeking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living by faith is probably the scariest thing you could ever choose to do. Some would say its the most foolish. In his book, By Faith And Fear, Elie takes you through conversations and questions of faith that are designed to challenge, stretch, and inspire. Focusing on contemporary issues and Biblical characters, Elie explains what living a life of faith can cost, but also how it can reap the biggest rewards. By Faith and Fear is an excellent read, one that will equip you for your personal faith journey.&lt;/p&gt;

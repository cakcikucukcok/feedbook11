      <meta name="description" content="Lovely psychic, Lily Rose, flees to the small town of Coombsville seeking anonymity from those who would do her harm, but, her enemies follow. They are no match for Lily Roses powers as she rescues people and animals with her telekinetic ability and does away with those who seek revenge for her past actions.&lt;p&gt;
She aligns herself with the towns vigilantes and animal protectors, Hardy and Estelle Johns, hoping to use her gifts to help animals, her passion.  However, when she is abducted by two men and told to help them rob their drug bosss safe, her life takes a sudden, unexpected turn. One of the robbers and the drug boss are killed, and Lily Rose flees with the remaining thief.  She survives the abduction and takes the windfall for herself and her beloved dog, Misty.  But is that really the end of the story?&lt;p&gt;
 	Sheriff Mitch Downey has fallen for Lily Rose, and he doesnt care what shes done, so when two crooked FBI agents try to steal the drug money for themselves, he must find a way to make it work for Lily Rose!" />

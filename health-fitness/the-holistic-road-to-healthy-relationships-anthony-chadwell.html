  <title>The Holistic Road to Healthy Relationships - Anthony Chadwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this era of our modern human culture, it is too easy for our lives to spin out of control. How we respond and react to everyday pressures cannot help but impact the most important aspect of our lives: RELATIONSHIPS. 
     The Chadwell Method brings practical and concise solutions to the reader for a higher consciousness approach to all types of relationships. You will learn quickly about how drama-loops and traumatic emotional overlays may be operating in your life and may lead to dysfunction.
     It is possible to get over past hurts and dysfunctional patterns. By applying Chadwells new concepts, it is not as difficult as you may believe. The simple suggestions given in this book provide tangible help to clarify what change is needed, the results you can expect by doing this work, and assurance that you will handle relationship situations in healthier ways, feeling better about yourself in the process.  You will attract people into your life with the same higher level of consciousness you are creating for yourself.
     Once you experience the sweetness this change brings, you will want more and more of it. When you make conscious improvement in even one area, it will favorably impact all of your relationships.
    This process is a fascinating evolution, one you will not want to miss. Use this book as a great place to start gaining more clarity about relationships. Then, by example, share that clarity and the fresh hope it brings with those you come in contact with throughout your life. This is one of the greatest rewards of conscious living.

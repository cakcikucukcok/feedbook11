&lt;br /&gt;
Women in Sunlight is the tenth book authored by Frances Mayes. Famous for her warmth, heart and delicious descriptions of Tuscany, Mayes delivers another heartwarming story under the Tuscan sun. Women in Sunlight begins in the garden of author Kit Raines as she observes her new neighbors in their new home. They were an uncanny trio of Southerners. Camille, Susan and Julia came from an orientation at a retirement community but decided to escape to Italy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Frances Mayes is the author of the 1996 bestseller Under The Tuscan Sun. Her beautiful memoir inspired a movie in picturesque Tuscany starring Diane Lane. People Magazine dubbed Mayes&amp;rsquo;s writing as &amp;ldquo;the next best thing to a plane ticket.&amp;rdquo; Library Journal mentions that Frances Mayes fans will surely be delighted with Women in Sunlight for noone can go wrong with &amp;ldquo;Sun and fun, food and friendship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;

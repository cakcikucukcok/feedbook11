      <meta name="description" content="The four short stories in &lt;I&gt;Nightmares in the Daylight&lt;/I&gt; depict kids in everyday situations that devolve into humorous happenings and strange events.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Fog?&lt;/I&gt; John is a mischievous kid who enjoys life at the expense of others until he meets a mysterious stranger. He doesn&#39;t realize it until it&#39;s too late, but when the &quot;fog&quot; floats away, life as he knows it floats away too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Red Sand&lt;/I&gt;. The Taylor family loves spending time at the beach. This is especially so for their son, Michael, who wants to live there. Then something unbelievable happens to him that may make his dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Act Like An Animal-Treated As Such&lt;/I&gt;. Dante is a good kid that made a bad decision to get what he wanted. He never dreamed that the consequence would leave him trapped like an animal with no way out.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>The Baseball Talmud - Howard Megdal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the icons of the game to the players who got their big break but never quite broke through, &lt;em&gt;The Baseball Talmud&lt;/em&gt; provides a wonderful historical narration of Major League Jewish Baseball in America. All the stats, the facts, the stories, and the (often unheralded) glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Baseball Talmud&lt;/em&gt; reveals that there is far more to Jewish baseball than Hank Greenberg&#39;s powerful slugging and Sandy Koufax&#39;s masterful control. From Ausmus to Zinn, Berg to Kinsler, Holtzman to Yeager, and many others, Megdal draws upon the lore and the little-known details that increase our enjoyment of the game, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which Jewish player spent a portion of his retirement as a spy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who received $50,000 and a car to quit school and join the Major Leagues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many players sat out of games scheduled on Yom Kippur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which famous player chose baseball over becoming a rabbi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is more than just stories. Megdal, a stat geek himself, uses the wealth of modern sabermetrics to determine the greatest Jewish players at each position, the all-time Jewish All-Star Team, and how they would rate against the greatest teams in baseball history, from the 1906 Chicago Cubs to the 1998 New York Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Baseball Talmud&lt;/em&gt; rewrites the history of Jewish baseball and is a book that every baseball fan should own.&lt;/p&gt;" />

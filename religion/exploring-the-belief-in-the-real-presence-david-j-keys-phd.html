  <title>Exploring the Belief in the Real Presence - David J. Keys, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Eucharistic celebration is an ancient ritual originating almost 2000 years ago. It took place during the last Passover supper Jesus had with his apostles on the day before he died. At that time, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the apostles, saying This is my body. Subsequently, Jesus took the wine, gave thanks and gave it to the apostles saying, This is my blood. Jesus commanded the apostles to Do this in memory of me.&lt;p&gt;
Currently, the religions of more than three-fourths of the worlds Christians believe that when these same words are said during their faiths Eucharistic liturgy, the bread and wine turn into the real presence of Jesus Christ, that is, into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus Christ. In addition, many individuals belonging to those religions which believe in the real presence have little understanding of the basis for this ancient belief.&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Exploring the Belief in the Real Presence&lt;/i&gt;, author Dr. David J. Keys provides an understanding of the real presence in the Eucharist for both newcomers to the principle and for those who wish to extend their belief to a deeper level. Through scripture and documentation, Keys shares the beauty and richness of this ancient teaching concerning the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist." />

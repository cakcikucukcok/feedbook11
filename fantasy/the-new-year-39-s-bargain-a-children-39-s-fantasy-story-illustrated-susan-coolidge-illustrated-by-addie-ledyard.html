  <title>THE NEW-YEAR&#39;S BARGAIN - A Children&#39;s Fantasy Story (Illustrated) - Susan Coolidge, Illustrated by Addie Ledyard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s Bargain&amp;rdquo; by Susan Coolidge is a lovely children&amp;#39;s story with charming illustrations throughout by Addie Ledyard, first published in 1871 and again in &amp;nbsp;1884.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story takes place in the Black Forest in Germany where two little children, Max and Thekla, come across Time creating the months of the year out of small moments. Max is unable to resist taking some moments for himself, and when the months come to demand their time back, he bargains with them to tell he and Thekla a story each month and to bring them a present. The stories have a mythical aura while still maintaining a Victorian sensibility about women&amp;#39;s roles and dead children. Even so, it is still a fascinating read. To be read to children by adults and scholars of children&amp;#39;s literature should definitely take a look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>The Screech Owls of Breast Cancer - Eugene G Breen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The tribute is: To all those brave women who suffer with breast cancer and to their families and friends. 
Breast cancer is a modern day plague affecting 1.6 million women this year. It is steadily increasing in numbers affected and in severity of disease aggression. Young women by far outnumber young men in numbers getting cancer and it is now the situation that young women get twice as much cancer as men. This is due to their vulnerability to breast cancer. Research, funding and medical focus have not abated this epidemic. Could it be that they are aiding and abetting its spread? Are some key players running with the hare and hunting with the hounds? Have they closed the stable door and allowed the horse to bolt and get new pastures in underdeveloped countries and amongst the young? Breast cancer is a demographic social and medical issue. It needs to tackled on all three fronts. It is an enigma that a simple answer to its predominant cause has not yet been discovered and eradicated." />

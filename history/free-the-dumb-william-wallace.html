      <meta name="description" content="Free the Dumb is about how Americans have lost their freedom by giving up their God given rights for privileges. The government should serve the people; the people should not serve the government. Will Rogers said, Its not what you dont know that hurts you.  Its what you know that aint so. Benjamin Franklin said, Anyone giving up rights for security deserves to lose both. Orville Wright said, If we were to accept truth as everything we were told to be true, there would be little hope for the human race. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Why lawyers are not citizens of the United States and why every law made after the 1840s is an illegal law? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
How you volunteered to be a subject citizen by not stating that you didnt volunteer even though you didnt know that you have to state that you didnt volunteer, which resulted in losing all the rights of a King, trading rights for privileges and illegally transferring non transferable rights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
How Americans support the ten planks of communism? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
How can you pledge allegiance to a Republic and live in a democracy when democracy is mentioned zero times in the United States Constitution, the Supreme Law of the Land? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

How the American people since March 9, 1933 became the enemy of the government? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why is Social Security under Treaty Law and should never run out of money? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is the difference between living in the United States vs. living in the united States of America? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

What are the rights of a jury and how to challenge jurisdiction? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why oil wells dont dry up? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why was lead taken out of paint? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

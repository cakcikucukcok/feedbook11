  <title>Boundless: Tracing Land and Dream in a New Northwest Passage - Kathleen Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In 2010, bestselling author Kathleen Winter (Annabel) embarked on a journey across the storied Northwest Passage, among marine scientists, historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, and curious passengers. From Greenland to Baffin Island and all along the passage, Winter bears witness to the new math of the North&amp;#151;where polar bears mates with grizzlies, creating a new hybrid species; where the earth is on the cusp of yielding so much buried treasure that five nations stand poised to claim sovereignty of the land; and where the local Inuit population struggles to navigate the tension between taking part in the new global economy and defending their traditional way of life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throughout Winter&amp;#8217;s journey, she learns from fellow passengers such as Aaju Peter and Bernadette Dean, who teach her about Inuit society (both past and present). She bonds with Nathan Rogers, son of the late Canadian icon Stan Rogers, who died in a plane crash when Nathan was just a young boy. Nathan&amp;#8217;s quest is to take the route his father never traveled, expect in his beloved song &amp;#147;The Northwest Passage,&amp;#8221; which he performs both as anthem and lament at sea. And she guides readers through her own personal odyssey, emigrating from England to Canada as a child and discovering both what was lot and what was gained as a result of that journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In breathtaking prose charged with vivid descriptions of the land and its people, Kathleen Winter&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Boundless&lt;/I&gt; is a haunting and powerful homage to the ever-evolving and magnetic power of the North.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

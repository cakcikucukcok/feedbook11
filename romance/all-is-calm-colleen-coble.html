  <title>All Is Calm - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brendan Waddell needs a place to recuperate. Lauren Everman needs a place to hide. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be an unexpectedly romantic Christmas at Bluebird Ranch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brendan Waddell has always considered Bluebird Ranch a little piece of heaven: an idyllic ranch that pairs abused children with abused horses, run by one of his old Marine buddies. Now, recovering from an on-the-job injury, Brendan thinks the ranch is the perfect place to spend Christmas healing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lauren Everman was a seventeen-year-old foster kid, Bluebird Ranch was the safest place she knew. Now it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect hideout for a woman on the run. As the witness to a murder, Lauren needs somewhere to lie low, and her skill with horses means she&amp;rsquo;ll be able to lend a hand with the troubled kids at Bluebird&amp;mdash;without answering too many questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren&amp;rsquo;s rich hair, high cheekbones, and dark eyes immediately get Brendan&amp;rsquo;s attention&amp;mdash;but so does her secretive behavior. This Special Ops Intel man knows a woman on the run when he sees one, and he&amp;rsquo;s not about to let her put Bluebird Ranch at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Brendan and Lauren get to know each other, their suspicions evaporate and romance starts to sizzle. But this would-be couple has more to worry about than each other&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s a killer on the loose who wants Lauren kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coble is a great writer, she knows what readers want and she does not disappoint.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />

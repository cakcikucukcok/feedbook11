He also  addresses the more serious issues facing sports today, including steroids, overpaid stars, athletes and violence, and the place of sports in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A must read for every sports fan, &lt;em&gt;Spanning the World&lt;/em&gt; is an irresistible blend of humor, history, and contemporary commentary on the state of sports from the ultimate fan who has seen it all.&lt;/p&gt;" />

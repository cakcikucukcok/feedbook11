  <title>Preparing Your Child for the Journey Through Adolescence - Indira Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The Handbook Preparing Your Child for the Journey Through Adolescence makes parents aware of and seeks to help to understand the hardships that await all adolescents in those trying, though exciting years. It goes further to help parents understand their children in totality, to guide parents on how to invest in their children while their children are still young in order to equip them for the trying years that wait ahead. For those whose children have already reached the stage of adolescence the Handbook offers parents guidance as to how to stay involved in their adolescents lives, and how to identify problems the adolescent may be experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; An interesting list of Principles for life and a comprehensive list of South African resources are provided to facilitate access to professional help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This book provides all the information needed to teach your children wholesome, Godly principles. It is a fantastic resource. I highly recommend this book to all parents. It would most definitely assist you during the difficult, adolescent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRUCE MALONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Research Leader, Chemical Engineer, Author, Father of Four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With today&#39;s increasing emphasis on the problems of teenagers, this book could hardly have been more timely and important. I know Indira Gilbert personally as a motivated and knowledgeable individual, whose qualities could not help but be reflected in her book.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

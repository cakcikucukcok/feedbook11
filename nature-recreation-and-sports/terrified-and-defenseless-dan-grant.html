  <title>Terrified and Defenseless - Dan Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Terrified and Defenseless is a story about one man&#39;s crusade to dish out his own form of vigilante justice.  But his aim is not at child molestors or rapists or arsonists or someone who has harmed him personally.  His aim is at those who willingly participate, fund or support cruelty towards animals.  With his new found wealth, he has dedicated his life to not only helping those who can&#39;t help themselves, not only to avenging the torture and murder of animals, but to try to make a change.  He believes that there are good organizations trying to do good things for animals.  However, no matter how many petitions, no matter how many peaceful protests, no matter how many celebrities cry out for clemency, unless one is willing to die for a cause, or better yet, kill for it, nothing will change.  Fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein once said: Anyone who clings to the historically untrue -- and -- thoroughly immoral doctrine that violence never solves anything I would advise to conjure up the ghosts of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington and let them debate it. The ghost of Hitler would referee. Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor; and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst. Breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and their freedoms.  In short, if you want to change something, you have to be willing to kill for it." />

      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Struggling to single-handedly raise her orphaned godson until a guardian was found, Annie Simmons was beginning to question God&#39; s plans for her life. Russell Mitchard&#39; s sudden appearance on her doorstep only added to her confusion. Especially when the stranger claimed that his grandfather&#39; s will dictated that he marry Annie!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Russell saw it, Annie ought to accept his proposal. After all, without a husband, she wouldn&#39; t stand a chance of gaining custody of the godson she obviously loved. But once she relented, Russell suddenly wasn&#39; t sure about anything. Especially not being a family man. Could Annie&#39; s strong faith help Russell dispel his doubts… and embrace the rich future God had planned for all of them?&lt;/p&gt;

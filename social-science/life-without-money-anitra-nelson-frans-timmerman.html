  <title>Life Without Money - Anitra Nelson, Frans Timmerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The money-based global economy is failing. The credit crunch undermined capitalism&#39;s ability to ensure rising incomes and prosperity while market-led attempts to combat climate change are fought tooth and nail by business as environmental crises continue.
We urgently need to combat those who say &#39;there is no alternative&#39; to the current system, but what would an alternative look like? The contributors to Life Without Money argue that it is time radical, non-market models were taken seriously. The book brings together diverse voices presenting strong arguments against our money-based system&#39;s ability to improve lives and prevent environmental disaster. Crucially, it provides a direct strategy for undercutting capitalism by refusing to deal in money, and offers money-free models of governance and collective sufficiency.
Life Without Money is written by high-profile activist scholars, including Harry Cleaver, Ariel Salleh and John O&#39;Neill, making it an excellent text for political economy and environmental courses, as well as an inspiring manifesto for those who want to take action." />

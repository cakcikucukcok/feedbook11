  <title>A Collection of Thoughts About Life - Ian William Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How this little book came about.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon discharge from hospital on the second occasion after a battle with a brain tumour, my wife Ruth and I set about the first appropriate step in cleaning out the cupboard of our lives, &lt;i&gt;as we termed it. &lt;/i&gt;Up until this point, we had paid little attention to the stresses in our lives, just accepting what is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first priority was to habitually harness more the developed awareness from our life experiences. We focused more on the idiosyncrasies of any acquaintance, looking past their persona to allow a greater accuracy of potential conformity to the collective personalities. This before any would make a profound entrance into our lives, opposed to having an ill-conceived come-all policy, to be whipped (metaphorically) by bad manner, lack of empathy or dishonesty. For some people, aggression seemingly forms a central part of their existence, creating their own epiphenomenon with its stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace is an element of life that should be available for all to rightfully inherit. Many never achieve this state, as motivational paralysis or a shallow belief in themselves can keep them suspended in continued dysfunctional unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people would agree that they deserve to be treated well, but there are many who expect high esteem to be bestowed on them. They give very little in return, while playing out their different versions of an inferiority/superiority complex or ignorance on others. The subject headings in this book are well known. The content presents a simple and brief reminder to the aspects of mans inherent or contrived nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sit awhile in silence and reflect on the condition of ones own life is to enable the beginning, if needed, toward assuagement of a better dawn, no matter where one is placed in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pull the contemptuous thorn of others from your mind&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;by the ability of distance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

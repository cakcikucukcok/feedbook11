        &lt;p&gt;When I first held you in my arms, I was Claire Davis, baby doctor. But soon I&#39;ll be &quot;Mom.&quot; You looked at me with your dark, magical eyes–Johnny Winterhawk&#39;s eyes–and you instantly became the child of my heart.

When he learned of you, he took you into his heart and home without reserve. I love him, Lucy, and I love you. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve agreed to marry him. And although he doesn&#39;t yet realize he loves me, too, soon he will…&lt;/p&gt;

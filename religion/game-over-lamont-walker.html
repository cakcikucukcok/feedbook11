  <title>Game Over - Lamont Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever heard someone use the analogy that &quot;Life is just a game&quot;? This maybe an old clich; however, many people unconsciously live their life as a game. Is it possible that you are living your life as a game and you just haven&#39;t recognized it? If so, I am personally reaching out to you through Game Over!  I believe God has equipped me to expose Satan and his wicked plan for those with this kind of attitude.  My prayer for you is that your eyes would be open through the knowledge I gained from my experience so that you can avoid satanic pitfalls that awaits you in the future.  My friend, Satan wants your perception of life to be a game.  In doing this, you will not take him, sin, nor God seriously.  After reading my story, you will discover this is exactly what I did.  I was living my life as a game and sadly &quot;the game&quot; ended in devastation. Nevertheless, you will read how my bitter tragedy turned into a sweet testimony after my encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ.  Friends this easy to read book is for everyone.  However, if you do not know Jesus as Savior and Lord; this God- inspired literature was written with you in mind.  ENJOY!" />

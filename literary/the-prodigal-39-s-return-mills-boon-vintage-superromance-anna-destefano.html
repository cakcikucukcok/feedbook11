          &lt;em&gt;Does going home mean living with the past–or living down the past?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The death of teenager Bobby Compton shocked the community of Rivermist, Georgia. It also destroyed the lives of Neal Cain and Jennifer Gardner. Neal was sent to prison, and Jennifer&#39; s life spiraled out of control until the birth of her daughter forced her to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, eight years later, Neal has come home to help his ailing father. Jennifer, a single mother, is also back, trying to make a go of things. Neal and Jennifer were in love when they were teenagers, and those feelings haven&#39; t gone away. But they&#39; re different people, shaped by everything that&#39; s happened. They can&#39; t change the past. Can they still have a future?&lt;/p&gt;

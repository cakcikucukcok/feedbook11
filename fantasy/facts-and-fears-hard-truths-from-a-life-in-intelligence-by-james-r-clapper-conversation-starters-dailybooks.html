  <title>Facts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence by James R. Clapper | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Facts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence&amp;nbsp;by James R. Clapper&amp;nbsp;| Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Facts and Fears, James R. Clapper uncovers the details about his work as a White House intelligence adviser, from the dangers of cyberattacks, to the truth about Russia&amp;rsquo;s part in the election of President Trump, to his own relationships with President Obama and the Congress. He recounts his efforts to debunk the idea that our private lives are being observed, and to make intelligence more straightforward and transparent. The author considers some controversial topics such as the ethics of intelligence and the morality of intercepting communications or photographing societies from above.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The book is a New York Times bestseller and reached #8 in Amazon. It was very well received amongst its readers, especially Trump&amp;rsquo;s opponents, and sparked controversy for the author&amp;rsquo;s declarations about the involvement of Russia in the last presidential elections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;

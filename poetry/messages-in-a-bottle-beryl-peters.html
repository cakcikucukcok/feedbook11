  <title>Messages in a Bottle - Beryl  Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beryl Peters is a medical doctor residing in South Africa. Being an avid reader all her life, she finally took the advice of her son and friends, putting pen to paper. What initially seemed like a daunting task took flight in the form of this collection of poems that represent not only the author&#39;s life, but her observations of human nature. Poetry is the ultimate form of art, where the myriad of human emotion and nature can be expressed through a kaleidoscope of words opening into the world of imagination. While medicine remains her first passion, the author hopes to share through her writing that although life often seems to be filled with sorrow, the sadness can never overshadow the little miraculous wonders if we take the time to discover them. Messages in a Bottle is one such miraculous wonder." />

  <title>Evolutionary Intelligence - Rolf W. Frohlich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Human nature holds the intelligence of life.  It provides a psychology that is much stronger, more effective and more reliable than the psychology society teaches us.  This psychology taps into the evolutionary survival experience of our species, which occupied most of human history.  It was the period when the species evolved and our ancestor survived as a hunter and gatherer.  More than 99% of human history is encoded in the DNA of our genes and lastingly etched into the human psyche.  Our natural psychology, the human psyche, is the result of evolutionary adaptation.  The psyche provides the genetic capacity for behavioral, mental and spiritual adaptation.  It supports the gratification of our needs.  And it contains the blueprint of human life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is about human nature and human survival.  Human nature, that is, the human psyche, has survival value.  The book introduces a metapsychology that refers to the Jungian archetypes and the survival capabilities inherent in the psyche.  Like all living organisms and forms of life, we possess an innate capacity for survival. By awakening this evolutionary intelligence, we gain access to the primordial power and wisdom of the archetypal psyche.  This innate psychology transcends the cultural conditioning that has shaped us all and erects an entirely different reference system  making us look at life in a new way.  We live in a world that reflects human nature and we are well equipped to survive in it.  Beyond that, there is also something in us that resonates with a larger context.  Our psychological constitution relates us to the outer realities of nature and cosmos.  It is in this sense that we partake in the evolution of life on this planet and in the larger design of a cosmic universe.  This primary psyche is shared by all humanity as part of a common biological and psychological history.&lt;/p&gt;" />

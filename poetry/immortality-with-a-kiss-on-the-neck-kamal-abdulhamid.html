  <title>Immortality with a Kiss on the Neck - Kamal Abdulhamid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book of poetry presents deep questions about the meaning of existence vs. nothingness, love vs. loss, and waiting vs. human uncertainty and confusion. It is a different book, it can be said that this is the poetic Noahs Ark, constructed by the poet with his soul, heart and questions in the face of the flood of human experiences and pains. 
In these poetic selections, the poet cannot nullify the power of death, neither physically nor spiritually, but he tries to understand what it means for a man to face, death, losses and disappointment, since his birth. He tries to understand the game of fate and its great deception. 
It is a book for souls haunted by existential confusion anywhere. Nothingness is fully embodied in these poems, which not only provides readers with the pleasure of cursory reading, but also takes them to their truthhuman beings, born to ask about the light that never comes." />

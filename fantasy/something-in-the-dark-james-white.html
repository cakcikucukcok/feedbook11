  <title>Something in the Dark - James White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Greedy, arrogant and fearless in his pursuit of gratification, Gerald Evans had few boundaries. But when he was careless with the money and wife of a major crime figure, consequences came in the form of underworld assassins. Although their first attempt to end Geralds life was successful, doctors and an angelic spirit are able to pull him back from the death that embraced his body and soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its then that Geralds family learns of the magnitude of his corruptions and also of the horrific story he relates about his journey to Hell, and the tortures he endured there during his brief but chilling death. Fearful of ever returning to that terrible place, Gerald is determined to repent his ways, but the killers are just as determined to complete their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspicious of Geralds story and intentions, his small and vulnerable family will reluctantly put themselves in harms way to protect a man that has tested their love and violated their trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the head of the family, Geralds brother-in-law, Jayme Harrison, will find himself caught between the influences of Heaven and Hell, assassins and police, while trying to keep the fractured family unified and the man he dislikes alive. Now with lives and souls at stake, they all have good reason to fear something in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;" />

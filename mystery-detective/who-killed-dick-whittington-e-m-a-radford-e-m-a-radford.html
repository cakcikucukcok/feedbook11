  <title>Who Killed Dick Whittington? - E. &amp; M.A. Radford, E. &amp; M.A. Radford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think you had better telephone for the police,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This woman has been poisoned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norma de Grey, the Principal in the Christmas pantomime &lt;em&gt;Dick Whittington&lt;/em&gt;, was not popular with the rest of the Pavilion Theatre company. But was she hated enough to be killed by prussic acid, during the performance itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspicion immediately falls on the Cat, her fellow actor in the fatal scene. Until it transpires that the Cat too has been poisoned &amp;ndash; and his understudy has a solid alibi. But someone must have donned the disguise and appeared on stage incognito. Detective-Inspector Harry Manson, analytical detective par excellence, is on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Killed Dick Whittington?&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1947. This new edition includes an introduction by crime fiction historian Nigel Moss.&lt;/p&gt;" />

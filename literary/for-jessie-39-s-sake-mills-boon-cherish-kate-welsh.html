  <title>For Jessie&#39;s Sake (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Kate Welsh</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;He’d do anything for his daughter&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Years ago Colin McCarthy was run out of town by Abby Hopewell’s wealthy, tyrannical father. Now he was a single father determined to make a stable home for his little girl. Until a stormy night brought the former bad boy face to face with the woman he thought he’d never see again…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Abby had never forgiven Colin for taking her love, then skipping out on her. But when he and his daughter showed up at her doorstep, how could she turn them away?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trusting the handsome businessman was out of the question…even as desire reignited, tempting Abby to risk her heart one last time.&lt;/p&gt;

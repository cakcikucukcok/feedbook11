  <title>Stone Butterfly - James D. Doss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ute shaman Daisy Perika is no stranger to eerie dreams, but when she has a nightmare, lives could be at stake. Convinced that her visions of a wisp-thin girl with blood dripping from her hands are omens, the old woman calls on her nephew, Charlie Moon. Moon, a part-time tribal investigator and full-time Colorado rancher, is skeptical, but he knows better than to dismiss his quarrelsome aunt too quickly. After all, she has been right before. But what can he do? Although Daisy can see what&#39;s left of a dying man&#39;s face, she can&#39;t get a clear look at the girl&#39;s. Without that, Moon doesn&#39;t have anything to go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he gets a call about a very real murder. Sarah Frank, an Ute-Papago orphan and daughter of Moon&#39;s childhood friend, was spotted standing over the battered body with blood on her hands. Moon and FBI Special Agent Lila Mae McTeague cross the border to investigate, but they&#39;re too late. Not only has little Sarah vanished with a one-of-a-kind family heirloom, but Moon and McTeague aren&#39;t the only ones on her trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the reservation and across states lines, James D. Doss&#39;s clever mystery finds Moon on the law enforcement side of the investigation and his aunt Daisy decidedly on the other.&lt;/p&gt;" />

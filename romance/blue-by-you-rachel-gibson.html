Yeah, it was hot while it lasted, but then he went off to join the Marines, leaving Blue in New Orleans. She&amp;#39;s tried to block him from her mind for good, but nothing can really erase the feeling she had when she was with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now he&amp;#39;s got the nerve to return&amp;#8212;leaner, meaner, and strong enough to pull her into his arms and kiss her senseless. Blue&amp;#39;s a successful businesswoman now, with no time to figure out what went wrong all those years ago. But Kasper knows she&amp;#39;s the one woman for him &amp;#8230; and now he&amp;#39;s got to prove it to her all over again.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Beyond the Dream - Irene Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Until the age of four, &lt;strong&gt;Irene Snow&lt;/strong&gt; lived happily with her mother and gentle, doting grandparents. The return of her father, a rough and tough soldier, at the close of World War II set the stage for rebellion and dissention in her young life. He was a strict disciplinarian, and she resented his authority from the outset. Whats more his arrival introduced her to the baser emotions of jealousy and hatred, which were previously beyond her ken as the reigning princess in Grandmas house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she grew older, her life became a search to regain the pedestal she lost, no matter what it took. As a young woman, she fell in love with a married German and had his child out of wedlock. Aware of her fathers deep and abiding enmity for the enemy, she reveled in his displeasure; he in turn vowed to disown his grandchild. Irenes seven-year love affair ended with her marriage to a Canadian widower, but her wedding was closely followed by a tragedy that ignited her darker emotions and eventually brought her to a nervous breakdown, psychosis, and utter darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned to the field of psychology in the hope it might shed light on her self-defeating behavior. While her studies provided many answers, they did not lead to peace. Finally, she embarked upon a spiritual journey that led her to A Course in Miracles. Once she began to reach out with love, her life changed dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  <title>Me and the Table - My Autobiography - Stephen Hendry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;STEPHEN HENDRY became the youngest professional snooker player in 1985 aged 16 and, in 1990, he was the youngest ever snooker World Champion, at the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widely regarded by fans and pundits alike as one of the greatest of all times in the sport, over a 27-year career, Hendry went on to win the World Championship seven times, and was snooker&#39;s world number one for eight consecutive seasons between 1990 and 1998. Hendry retired in 2012 with a record-breaking seven World Champion titles under his belt, a record that remains to this day. Now, he&#39;s ready to tell his life story for the first time - from a childhood spent climbing the ranks of the sport, through the highs of the 90s and lows of the 2000s, to his life now as a sports pundit and commentator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an insight into the life of the man behind the cue, and what made him such a top-class player, this is the definitive autobiography of the legend that is, Stephen Hendry.&lt;/p&gt;" />

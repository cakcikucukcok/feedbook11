  <title>Damsel - Elana K. Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*A 2019 Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A dark, twisted, unforgettable fairy tale from Elana K. Arnold, author of the National Book Award finalist &lt;em&gt;What Girls Are Made Of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rite has existed for as long as anyone can remember: When the king dies, his son the prince must venture out into the gray lands, slay a fierce dragon, and rescue a damsel to be his bride. This is the way things have always been. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ama wakes in the arms of Prince Emory, she knows none of this. She has no memory of what came before she was captured by the dragon or what horrors she faced in its lair. She knows only this handsome young man, the story he tells of her rescue, and her destiny of sitting on a throne beside him. It&amp;#8217;s all like a dream, like something from a fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ama follows Emory to the kingdom of Harding, however, she discovers that not all is as it seems. There is more to the legends of the dragons and the damsels than anyone knows, and the greatest threats may not be behind her, but around her, now, and closing in.&lt;/p&gt;" />

My hope is that anyone who has or has someone in their lives with autism may be able to identify with what is written. I have not always been able to communicate verbally how I was feeling or what was going on in my life, especially when I was young. I was confused and frightened as to how people would react to my explanation of my feelings. Also, my actions and reactions were not always met with positive responses or understanding." />

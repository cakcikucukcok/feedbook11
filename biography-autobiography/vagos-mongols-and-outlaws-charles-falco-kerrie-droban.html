  <title>Vagos, Mongols, and Outlaws - Charles Falco, Kerrie Droban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The basis for the hit TV series &lt;i&gt;Gangland Undercover&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gripping account from an ex-con who went undercover to help the ATF infiltrate three of America&#39;s most violent biker gangs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite lacking any experience with motorcycle gangs, Charles Falco infiltrated three of America&#39;s deadliest biker gangs: the Vagos, Mongols, and Outlaws. In separate investigations that spanned years and coasts, Falco risked his life, suffering a fractured neck and a severely torn shoulder, working deep under cover to bring violent sociopaths to justice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His dedication was profound; Falco spent almost three years infiltrating the Vagos gang and rose to second in command of the Victorville, California chapter. He even served time in San Bernardino&#39;s Murder Unit and endured solitary confinement to protect his cover and the investigations. Falco recorded confessions of gangland-style killings and nearly became a target himself before he sought refuge in the Witness Protection Program. But discontent to remain on the sidelines and motivated by a strong sense of duty, Falco eventually left the Program and volunteer his talents again to infiltrate the Mongols and Outlaws, rising in rank to Vice President of the Petersburg, Virginia Outlaws chapter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His efforts culminated in sixty two arrests of members for various crimes, including assault and murder. Executing one of this country&#39;s most successful RICO prosecutions and effectively crippling the criminal enterprise, Falco&#39;s engrossing narrative of the dangers of the biker underworld harkens back to Hunter S. Thompson&#39;s classic &lt;i&gt;Hell&#39;s Angels, &lt;/i&gt;vividly recounting a life undercover.&lt;/p&gt;" />
